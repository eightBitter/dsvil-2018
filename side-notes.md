## Why metadata?

- discovery
- context/understanding

## Notes to self

- pick Juliane's brain about ontology work at Harvard; also pick Juliane's brain about metadata services for researchers; most of her career has been around indexing and discovery
- after learning about statistics, I have a good sense that I have little interest or aptitude for statistics, probably because it is math based, where as I'm interested in language. I get much more excited in discovery, meaning
- maybe do some data visualization of the library knowledge graph (see trees, hierarchies, networks)
- find an excuse to practice visualization
- check out wikidata reconciliation. there are nice interfaces for pulling in extra data
- check out BookDown (https://bookdown.org/), an R package for publishing Markdown files as an ebook
- **project idea**: do a network analysis of your collaborative works at NCSU. Pulling out projects and teams to show the collaborations you've been doing
- maybe check out the [SemanticWeb plugin](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/SemanticWebImport) for Gephi
  - this plugin is already in Tools > Plugins of Gephi
- now that you have a general set of data science skills, what are your specializations?
  - examples: SEO, semantic web, data modeling, [add more]

## Questions to self

- If the RDC does consultation at the pre-proposal and post-award stages of funded research, where does DVS fit? Do we fit in the middle, where data aggregation, cleaning, playing, explorations happens? Do we fit in non-funded research? What that mean with regard to metadata services we may provide?
