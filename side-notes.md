## Why metadata?

- discovery
- context/understanding

## Notes to self

- pick Juliane's brain about ontology work at Harvard; also pick Juliane's brain about metadata services for researchers; most of her career has been around indexing and discovery
- after learning about statistics, I have a good sense that I have little interest or aptitude for statistics, probably because it is math based, where as I'm interested in language. I get much more excited in discovery, meaning
- maybe do some data visualization of the library knowledge graph (see trees, hierarchies, networks)
- find an excuse to practice visualization
- check out wikidata reconciliation. there are nice interfaces for pulling in extra data
- check out BookDown (https://bookdown.org/), an R package for publishing Markdown files as an ebook
