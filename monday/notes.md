## Opening Keynote: Start With Do: Expertise + Facility With Tools = Change

Speaker: Juliane Schneider

- Being an expert in an area helps push change in your organization
- **Note to self**: pick Juliane's brain about ontology work at Harvard; also pick Juliane's brain about metadata services for researchers; most of her career has been around indexing and discovery
- Doing your expertise grounds you
- Becoming an expert while with others helps you network and gives you an outlet for talking with others who know what you're going through
- Data isn't real until people see it
- Data visualization helps you tell a story, and make a case
- Juliane's recommendation for taking time to learn things: make friends with experts in areas you'd like to work; finding projects where you can learn the expertise; forcing yourself into learning opportunities like Library Carpentry

## FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA, PART 1

Instructor: Emily Griffith

- fundamentals of data from the perspective of a statistician
- statistics takes data and turns it into information
- two big domains of data: experimental (cause and effect) and observational (surveys; association)
- two big types of data: qualitative (nominal; ordinal) and quantitative (discrete and continuous)
- causation: this made this happen
- association: these all happen and are associated
- First thing to do with a dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis
  - summary statistics
  - plots
  - understand the nature of the data
  - benefits
    - outlier detection
    - finding mistakes and typos
    - understanding missing values
- long vs wide (multiple years in one column or Year 1 and Year 2 columns)
- typical challenges
  - challenges with research questions
    - is the question measurable; has it been measured already
    - need to have a research question
  - challenges with data
    - need to know implications, potential ways the data can be bad
  - challenges with communication
  - post-mortem analyses
    - poor designs
    - there's always something, however tiny, that you can say based on the data
  - data/question misalignment
    - lack of clarity up-front
    - data collection issues (ex. surveys)
    - measurement/equipment problems
      - document weird things. can adjust/fix

## FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA, PART 2

Instructor: Emily Griffith

- statistical analysis decision tree, Google it
- graphical decision tree, Google it
- data analysis path
  - start with research question
  - look at the available dataset- figure out an analysis plan
  - draw conclusions
- role of statistical consultants
  - planning a study
    - power and sample size
    - experimental design
    - survey design
    - grant preparation
  - analysis
    - advice: help a client figure out what to do
    - guidance: help a client figure out how to do it
    - full-service: do the analysis and report methods and results
  - results
    - help interpret the results of a statistical analysis
    - write methods and results sections of manuscripts
    - graphics and visuals (expertise on how to represent the data, but a graphical designer has expertise on how to make the graphics look professional)

## CONVERSATION WITH FACULTY ABOUT DATA

Speakers: Kris Alpi, Paul Fyfe, Hollylynne Lee, Maria Mayorga, and Darby Orcutt

Q1: Challenges with data you use for research
  - Maria
    - Pulls in data from a lot of different sources for a specific research model
    - Help point: documentation. documenting the process involved
    - How do we get to high-end computing when we're trying to use private data
    - For privacy reasons, sometimes Maria has to have somebody else run her code on the data
  - Paul
    - Help point: how to communicate the ethos of open data
    - **Help point: reconciling the metadata standards used across different data sources**
  - Hollylynne
    - merging data from different sources
  - Darby

Q2: How does the type of data you work with lead to collaborations across disciplines? What roles have or could librarians play in fostering or supporting these collaborations
  - Paul
    - Paul looks to the library to help facilitate connections, serendipity
  - Hollylynne
    - Open concept workshops, meetings, etc to facilitate serendipity and interdisciplinary work
  - Maria
    - in order for Maria and her discipline to share their data, something needs to happen. They are currently protective of their data
    - we need to be better at training students about data dissemination and best practices?
  - Darby + Maria
    - Discussion of open vs closed. Maria's argument is that, for example, it might take Maria five years to build a dataset. If she publishes that data and some scrappy grad student uses that data for a research project before she has the chance to, is that fair? Is a tradeoff creating an embargo period for the data?
  - Hollylynne
    - data science education is important, but I don't have the time to teach my students. this is where libraries can help by provided workshops

Q3: Learning skills for personal interest/research and learning skills that become high in demand
  - Darby
    -
Q about data management plans
  - Hollylynne
    - Public vs private
    - Often times private entities are trying to get the data out quick and disseminate it widely and aren't too worried about good data management practices. Should private data management planning be as rigorous as public entities?
