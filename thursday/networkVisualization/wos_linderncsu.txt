AB Since the first description of discoid lupus erythematosus (LE) in two dogs in 1979, the spectrum of canine cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) variants has expanded markedly.
   In this review, we first propose an adaptation of the Gilliam-Sontheimer classification of CLE for dogs. We then review the signalment, clinical signs, laboratory and histopathology and treatment outcome of the currently recognized variants of canine CLE, which are vesicular CLE, exfoliative CLE, mucocutaneous LE and facial or generalized discoid LE. We end with a short description of the rare cutaneous manifestations of systemic LE in dogs.
   Canine CLE variants are heterogeneous, some of them mirror their human counterparts while others appear-thus far-unique to the dog. As most CLE subtypes seem to have a good prognosis after diagnosis, veterinarians are encouraged to become familiar with the spectrum of often-characteristic and unique clinical signs that would permit an early diagnosis and the rapid implementation of an effective treatment.

TI Generalized papillomatosis in three horses associated with a novel
   equine papillomavirus (EcPV8)
SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SEQUENCES
AB BackgroundCurrently, seven equine papillomaviruses (PV) are known and are associated with one of three different and distinct clinical presentations.
   Hypothesis/ObjectivesTo report the clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical findings in horses with generalized papillomatosis associated with a novel equine PV, Equus caballus papillomavirus 8 (EcPV8).
   AnimalsThree client-owned quarter horses.
   MethodsCase report, retrospective.
   ResultsDozens to thousands of papillomas involved the axilla, inguinal area and proximal limbs as well as the ventral and lateral neck, thorax and abdomen. Lesions were sometimes confluent in ventral areas. Fewer lesions were on the face, ears, distal limbs and genitalia. Plaque-type papillomas were small, 0.5 to 1.5 cm in diameter and hyperkeratotic. Histologically, plaque-type papillomas prominently involved follicular infundibula. Immunohistochemical findings demonstrated PV antigen in superficial keratinocyte nuclei. PCR using degenerate primers for the PV L1 gene and sequencing of amplicons revealed PV DNA sequences that were 98% identical for all three cases, but shared <70% identity to other PVs. Horses were otherwise healthy; serum immunoglobulin levels and peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotyping did not identify a known immunodeficiency syndrome. Lesions nearly completely resolved after 1.5 years in one horse and persisted for two years in another, despite intralesional human IFN-alpha treatment. The oldest horse was lost to follow-up.
   Conclusion and clinical importanceA novel equine papillomavirus (EcPV8) is associated with a distinct, plaque-type, generalized papillomatosis. Papillomas persisted for months to years, with or without treatment.

AB BackgroundIt has been reported that topical hypochlorous acid (HOCl) formulations lead to relief of itch in human patients with atopic dermatitis; however, the specific antipruritic mechanism of action remains unclear.
   ObjectiveTo confirm itch relief and reduction of lesions in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis and to elucidate possible HOCl's mode of action.
   MethodsIn this study, the effects of topical administration of HOCl hydrogel (0.05%) on atopic dermatitis-like lesions in NC/Nga mice model as well as in vitro effects of HOCl on dorsal root ganglia neurons and mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (mBMDCs) were investigated. NC/Nga mice were sensitized with house dust mite allergen and treated topically with HOCl hydrogel both preventively and therapeutically against established lesions. Allergen challenge was continued during HOCl hydrogel application.
   ResultsTreatment with HOCl hydrogel prevented the development of lesions and scratching bouts during the whole observation period. When administered after full development of lesions, HOCl reduced lesions and scratching behaviour to a similar extent as a positive control 0.1% betamethasone dipropionate ointment. The reduced inflammatory response by HOCl treatment was demonstrated by reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines in affected skin tissue from NC/Nga mice. In addition, HOCl significantly reduced IL-12 production in mBMDC. The diminished scratching behaviour was confirmed by impaired response to several pruritogens in dorsal root ganglia neurons excised from NC/Nga mice after termination of the studies. The response to the stimuli was also reduced by pre-incubation of sensory neurons from untreated BALB/c mice with 0.0001% HOCl.
   Conclusions and Clinical RelevanceThese data indicate a direct reduction in sensory response by HOCl, leading to significantly reduced itch and inflammation in vivo.

AB The objectives of this study were to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of subcutaneously delivered carboplatin in poloxamer 407 in rats. Carboplatin (5mg/rat) in 0.5ml poloxamer 407 (1.0 ml total volume) was administered subcutaneously in a right subcutaneous perineal incision in all 12 treatment rats. Three control rats received 1.0 ml of poloxamer 407. Total platinum was measured in plasma q24hrs from 0 to 168hrs. Protein-unbound platinum was measured in plasma at 168hrs. After sacrifice on day 7, total platinum was determined in wound bed muscle. Platinum concentrations in all samples were measured by ICP-MS. Wounds were visually assessed daily for 7 days. Perineal tissues (full wound bed including muscle, subcutis, skin) were assessed histologically and scored. Total platinum was detectable in plasma from 24 to 168 hrs. Total plasma platinum AUC and C-max were 9,165.3 ng/mL.h and 129.4 ng/mL. Day 7 total platinum concentration in muscle was approximately 10-fold higher than total plasma platinum concentration. No unbound platinum was detected in plasma samples at 168 hours. No wound healing complications were detected at any time point, nor was tissue necrosis observed histologically. The results of this study suggest that subcutaneous carboplatin in poloxamer 407 can be used in vivo providing direct tissue exposure to carboplatin without significant local effects or systemic absorption and without wound healing complications.

TI Scleromyxoedema in a dog
SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID LICHEN MYXEDEMATOSUS; CUTANEOUS MUCINOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; FIBROBLASTS
AB Background - In humans, scleromyxoedema is a chronic progressive skin condition traditionally characterized by deposits of mucin, increased number of fibroblasts and fibrosis in the skin, and by systemic disease. Thyroid disease is typically absent. A monoclonal gammopathy is usually present, as are other comorbidities. Descriptions of scleromyxoedema in the veterinary literature are limited to a single feline case. One dog, previously reported as having papular mucinosis, exhibited features that matched the more current diagnostic criteria of scleromyxoedema.
   Objectives - To describe generalized papular mucinosis in a dog with systemic illness and to compare the signs with those of human lichen myxoedematosus conditions, specifically scleromyxoedema.
   Results - A nine-year-old female, spayed English springer spaniel dog presented with generalized papules and nodules (0.5-5 cm) on the body and proximal fore and hind limbs, sparing the face and distal limbs distal to carpi/tarsi. Larger nodules were erythematous. Nodules occurred in proximal limb muscles. The dog had concurrent osteoarthritis of the elbows and coxofemoral joints, developed generalized weakness, declined in health and was euthanized. Thyroid disease was lacking and a monoclonal gammopathy was not present. Histopathological evaluation revealed the classic triad of mucin, fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis with very mild inflammation, as described for humans.
   Conclusion and clinical importance - We document scleromyxoedema in a dog with significant morbidity and features of the human disease. Recognizing the typical histopathology is important for identifying cases and to establish a diagnosis. Systemic evaluation is important to identify evidence of internal disease and associated comorbidities, which are common, variable, and impact classification and prognosis in humans.

AB An 11-year-old, 443-kg Haflinger mare was presented to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a 2-week history of lethargy and a 3-day duration of anorexia, pyrexia, tachycardia, and ventral edema. Severe pitting edema, peripheral lymphadenopathy, and a caudal abdominal mass were noted on physical examination. An extreme leukocytosis (154.3 x 10(3)/L) and microscopic hematologic findings suggestive of myelomonocytic leukemia were observed. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal gammopathy and urine protein electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal light chain proteinuria. Necropsy and histopathology confirmed widespread neoplastic infiltration in many organs with a heterogenous population of cells; there was no apparent evidence of bone marrow involvement. Immunohistochemistry confirmed presence of a majority of B cells with a limited antigen expression, admixed with a lower number of T cells. Molecular clonality analysis of IgH2, IgH3, and kappa-deleting element (KDE, B cell) on whole blood and KDE on infiltrated tissues revealed clonal rearrangements, and the KDE intron clones that amplified in blood and in infiltrated tissue were identical. In contrast, the clonality analysis of T-cell receptor revealed no clonality on blood cells and infiltrated tissues. In conjunction with the histopathologic changes, the lesion was interpreted to be composed of neoplastic B cells with a reactive T-cell population. Polymerase chain reaction testing for equine herpes virus 5 was negative. The final diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with a marked hematogenous component.

ID STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME; ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME; DERMATITIS
AB In humans and dogs, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a life-threatening dermatosis characterized by sudden epidermal death resulting in extensive skin detachment. There is little information on the pathogenesis of keratinocyte cell death in canine TEN. We studied the occurrence of apoptosis in skin lesions of dogs with TEN to determine if apoptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of this disease. Immunostaining with antibodies to activated caspase-3 and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling technique revealed positive apoptotic keratinocytes in basal and suprabasal epidermal compartments in 17 biopsy specimens collected from 3 dogs with TEN and 16 from 3 dogs with erythema multiforme (EM). There was no significant difference in the number of positively stained epidermal cells between TEN and EM. These results suggest that apoptosis of epidermal keratinocytes and lymphocytic satellitosis represent one of the early steps in the pathogenesis of canine TEN, as in the human disease counterpart.

TI Clinical, microscopic and microbial characterization of exfoliative
   superficial pyoderma-associated epidermal collarettes in dogs
SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background - The microscopic and microbial features of the spreading epidermal collarettes of canine exfoliative superficial pyodermas are poorly characterized.
   Objectives - To characterize the clinical, cytological, microbial and histopathological features of epidermal collarettes in five dogs.
   Results - Cytology from the margins of collarettes identified neutrophils, extracellular and intracellular cocci within neutrophils but no acantholytic keratinocytes. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses identified all bacterial isolates from the centre and margin of five epidermal collarettes as Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. PCRs of collarette-associated Staphylococcus strains did not amplify genes encoding for the known exfoliative toxins expA and expB, whereas the predicted siet and speta amplification products were detected in all isolates. Microscopically, epidermal collarettes consisted of interfollicular, epidermal spongiotic pustules. Advancing edges of lesions consisted of peripheral intracorneal clefts in the deep stratum disjunctum above an intact stratum compactum; they contained lytic neutrophil debris, bacterial cocci and fluid, but no acantholytic keratinocytes. This intracorneal location of bacteria was confirmed using Gram stains and fluorescent in situ hybridization with eubacterial- and Staphylococcus-specific probes. The indirect immunofluorescence staining patterns of desmoglein-1, desmocollin-1, claudin-1, E-cadherin and corneodesmosin were discontinuous and patchy in areas of spongiotic pustules, whereas only that of corneodesmosin was weaker and patchy in advancing collarette edges.
   Conclusion - Epidermal collarettes represent unique clinical and histological lesions of exfoliative superficial pyodermas that are distinct from those of impetigo and superficial bacterial folliculitis. The characterization of possible causative staphylococcal exfoliatin proteases and the role of corneodesmosin in collarette pathogenesis deserve further investigation.

AB AimsPyoderma, predominantly associated with Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, is a common skin infection of dogs that typically requires long-lasting treatments, complicated by increasing antimicrobial resistance. To investigate new treatment strategies, we aimed at establishing a dog model of pyoderma that closely mimics the natural disease.
   Methods and ResultsWe inoculated six laboratory beagles with a methicillin-susceptible strain of S. pseudintermedius. One millilitre of approximately 10(7), 10(8), 10(9) CFU per ml was topically applied onto clipped and tape stripped area of dog skin, which was then treated with a dermaroller (microneedle size: 500m) immediately after administration. Dogs were monitored daily, suspect pustules were cultured for S. pseudintermedius and evaluated by cytological and histopathological methods. After 24h, all dogs developed papules and pustules at all three bacterial inoculation sites, which worsened over the next 48h. Cytological samples of all skin lesions revealed neutrophils with intracellular cocci. Histopathology confirmed subcorneal neutrophilic pustular dermatitis with intralesional cocci and acantholytic keratinocytes, consistent with superficial pyoderma. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was isolated from pustules of all dogs and confirmed to be the inoculating strain. The results were replicated in all dogs after a wash out period of 6weeks.
   ConclusionsThese data demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a dog model of pyoderma.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThe new model can be used to evaluate novel prevention and treatment options for canine pyoderma.

AB 2-Aminoimidazole (2-AI)-based compounds have been shown to efficiently disrupt biofilm formation, disperse existing biofilms, and resensitize numerous multidrug-resistant bacteria to antibiotics. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, we provide initial pharmacological studies regarding the application of a 2-AI as a topical adjuvant for persistent dermal infections. In vitro assays indicated that the 2-AI H10 is nonbactericidal, resensitizes bacteria to antibiotics, does not harm the integument, and promotes wound healing. Furthermore, in vivo application of H10 on swine skin caused no gross abnormalities or immune reactions. Taken together, these results indicate that H10 represents a promising lead dermal adjuvant compound.

AB BackgroundGeneralized discoid lupus erythematosus (GDLE) is a newly recognized canine variant of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) that is not well characterized.
   Hypothesis/ObjectivesWe report herein the signalment, clinical signs, treatment outcome, histopathology and immunological findings of 10 dogs with GDLE.
   MethodsInclusion criteria were: (i) a >3 month history of generalized skin lesions indicating a chronic or recurrent nature; (ii) skin lesions resembling those of human GDLE; (iii) histopathology of CLE (lymphocyte-rich interface dermatitis). Direct immunofluorescence (IF) and antinuclear antibody serology were investigated whenever possible.
   ResultsVarious breeds were affected in their mid- to late adulthood. Selection criteria of generalized multifocal, annular (discoid) to polycyclic plaques with pigment changes, erythematous margin, adherent scaling, follicular plugging and central alopecia were shown in all dogs. In nine dogs, plaques contained mild to moderate central scarring with depigmentation and/or hyperpigmentation. There were no dogs in which the disease progressed to systemic lupus erythematosus within a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Per inclusion criteria, interface dermatitis occurred with basement membrane zone (BMZ) thickening, suprabasal apoptosis and/or dermal fibrosis in some dogs. Infundibular interface folliculitis was common; it sometimes transitioned to mural folliculitis in lower follicle segments, and occurred with follicular and sebaceous gland atrophy. The direct IF revealed patchy deposition of immunoglobulin IgG and IgM at the BMZ. Lesions responded to a variety of treatments, including ciclosporin, hydroxychloroquine, topical tacrolimus and tetracycline/niacinamide. Relapses were common after medications were tapered.
   Conclusions and clinical importanceThese observations support the existence of a canine homologue of human GDLE.

AB Background - Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a chronic autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease of dogs, cats and humans.
   Objectives - The goal of this study was to describe the clinical, histological and immunological features and treatment outcomes of canine MMP.
   Animals - Sixteen dogs were diagnosed with MMP based on the presence of mucosal- or mucocutaneous-predominant vesiculation and/or ulceration, histological confirmation of subepidermal clefting and an age of disease onset greater than 6 months.
   Results - Six of 16 dogs (38%) were German shepherd dogs and their crosses. The median age of disease onset was 6 years (range: 1-10 years). At the time of presentation, the dogs exhibited erosions and ulcers in the oral cavity (11 of 16; 69%), nasal (nine of 16; 56%), periocular (eight of 16; 50%) and genital (six of 16; 38%) regions. Haired skin lesions were less frequent (six of 16; 38%) and involved mostly concave pinnae. Information on treatment outcome was available for 11 dogs (69%). A complete remission (CR) of lesions was achieved in 10 of 11 dogs (91%). The median time to CR was 33 weeks (range: 6-64 weeks). Treatment regimens varied widely but six of 10 (60%) dogs received a combination of tetracycline antibiotic and niacinamide alone, or with another drug, at the time of CR. Forty percent of the dogs in which CR had occurred experienced lesion relapse upon drug dose reduction.
   Conclusions and clinical importance - Canine MMP is a chronic and relapsing disease requiring long term treatment. Combination therapy is often needed to achieve CR.

AB Determining inflammation and itch pathway activation in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is fraught with the inability to precisely assess the age of skin lesions, thus affecting the analysis of time-dependent mediators. To characterize inflammatory events occurring during early experimental acute AD lesions, biopsy samples were collected 6, 24, and 48 hours after epicutaneous application of Dermatophagoides farinae house dust mites to sensitized atopic dogs. The skin transcriptome was assessed using a dog-specific microarray and quantitative PCR. Acute canine AD skin lesions had a significant up-regulation of genes encoding T helper (Th) 2 (e.g., IL4, IL5, IL13, IL31, and IL33), Th9 (IL9), and Th22 (IL22) cytokines as well as Th2-promoting chemokines such as CCL5 and CCL17. Proinflammatory (e.g., IL6, LTB, and IL18) cytokines were also up-regulated. Other known pruritogenic pathways were also activated: there was significant up-regulation of genes encoding proteases cathepsin S (CTSS), mast cell chymase (CMA1), tryptase (TPS1) and mastin, neuromedin-B (NMB), nerve growth factor (NGF), and leukotriene-synthesis enzymes (ALOX5, ALOX5AP, and LTA4H). Experimental acute canine house dust mite-induced AD lesions exhibit an activation of innate and adaptive immune responses and pruritogenic pathways similar to those seen in humans with acute AD, thereby validating this model to test innovative therapeutics modalities for this disease.

AB Introduction: To describe the clinical presentation, clinicopathological abnormalities and outcomes of a series of cats diagnosed with infective endocarditis (IE) at two tertiary care referral institutions.
   Animals: Thirteen client-owned cats presenting to the cardiology or emergency services of tertiary referral institutions with a diagnosis of endocarditis based on the modified Duke criteria.
   Materials and methods: Retrospective case series. Medical records were reviewed to extract relevant data. In addition, cases that had cardiac tissue available were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of Bartonella DNA.
   Results: Prevalence of feline IE was 0.007%. Cats with endocarditis tended to be older (median age: 9 years, range: 2-12 years) and no sex or breed was overrepresented. Commonly encountered clinical signs included respiratory distress (n = 5) and locomotor abnormalities of varying severity (n = 5). Echocardiographic examination detected valvular lesions consistent with endocarditis on the aortic (n = 8) or mitral (n = 5) valves. Nine cats were diagnosed with congestive heart failure at the time of endocarditis diagnosis. Overall, prognosis was grave with a median survival time of 31 days.
   Conclusions: In contrast to dogs, cats with IE typically present with clinical signs consistent with cardiac decompensation and locomotor abnormalities suggestive of either thromboembolic disease or inflammatory arthritis. Given the advanced state of disease when diagnosis typically occurs, prognosis is grave. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis due to PNPLA1 mutation in a
   golden retriever-poodle cross-bred dog and the effect of topical therapy
SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID JACK RUSSELL TERRIER; CORNIFICATION
AB Background - Ichthyoses represent a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous syndrome of abnormal epidermal cornification. Although the clinical presentation, histopathological findings and genetic cause of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) in golden retriever dogs have been well investigated, the optimal management of this disease remains uncharacterized.
   Objectives - In this report we describe the beneficial effect of oral and topical fatty acids for management of a golden retriever and poodle cross-bred dog (goldendoodle) with ARCI due to a PNPLA1 (Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 1) mutation.
   Case report - A six-month-old, intact female, second generation golden retriever and poodle cross-bred dog presented with a history of generalized scaling since the age of 6 weeks. Histopathology showed diffuse, laminated-to-compact hyperkeratosis with a single small perinuclear vacuole in occasional stratum granulosum keratinocytes. Genetic testing revealed a homozygotic insertion/deletion mutation in the gene PNPLA1. Daily oral fatty acid supplementation and humectant rinse, following weekly moisturizing shampoo, resulted in only mild improvement after two months. Weekly application of a topical essential oils and fatty acid product was then added. Thirteen months after the initial presentation the dog exhibited a marked improvement in clinical signs. The temporal discontinuation of topical therapy resulted in the worsening of scaling, which improved again after resuming this combination.
   Conclusions and clinical importance - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report of ARCI with homozygous PNPLA1 mutation in a golden retriever-poodle cross-bred dog. The long-term combination of oral fatty acids and topical therapy appeared to be beneficial in this case.

ID SYSTEMIC-SCLEROSIS; MUTATIONS; DIAGNOSIS
AB Background - Stiff skin syndrome and systemic or localized scleroderma are cutaneous disorders characterized by dermal fibrosis and present clinically with induration of the skin, with or without joint, internal organ or vascular involvement.
   Objectives - To provide clinical, histological and preliminary genetic analysis of two West Highland white terrier siblings presenting with indurated skin resembling stiff skin syndrome in humans.
   Animals - Two client owned full sibling West Highland white terriers from two different litters.
   Methods - Clinical examination, histopathological examination and whole genome sequencing analysis of affected and unaffected West Highland white terriers.
   Results - Affected dogs exhibited markedly indurated skin that was attached firmly to the underlying tissue and incomplete closure of the mouth and eyes. No abnormalities were found by neurological or orthopaedic examination, radiographs of the head or whole body computed tomography. Histologically, the dermis and pannicular septa were thickened by a marked increase in coarse collagen fibres and a mild to moderate increase in collagen fibre diameter. The syndrome most likely follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The sequence analysis did not reveal any obvious causative variant in the investigated candidate genes ADAMTSL2 and FBN1.
   Conclusion and clinical importance - The clinical phenotype and histopathological features of two West Highland white terrier siblings resembled stiff skin syndrome in humans. Unlike in humans, or previously described beagles with stiff skin, there was no restriction of joint mobility. Genetic analysis did not detect a candidate causative variant and warrants further research.

TI Protozoal nodular dermatitis and panniculitis in a Rottweiler puppy
   caused by Caryospora bigenetica
SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY

DT Article
ID DOGS; INFECTIONS; DIAGNOSIS
AB BackgroundCaryospora bigenetica is an intracellular protozoan parasite in snakes and raptors (primary hosts) and rodents (secondary host). Experimental infection has been documented in mice, pigs and goats; natural infection in dogs is rare.
   ObjectivesTo describe the clinical presentation, histological features, treatment and outcome of a case of protozoal nodular dermatitis and panniculitis in a Rottweiler puppy caused by C. bigenetica.
   ResultsThe puppy presented with generalized subcutaneous nodules measuring up to 2 cm in diameter. Histopathology revealed marked suppurative to pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis with intralesional protozoal organism. PCR and DNA sequencing confirmed infection with C. bigenetica. Treatment with a combination of oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS), pyrimethamine and high-dose clindamycin (20 mg/kg twice daily) resulted in resolution of lesions in 6 weeks. Discontinuation of the treatment 2 weeks later was followed by a rapid relapse of skin lesions. Clindamycin and TMS were restarted and all lesions resolved within 2 weeks; TMS was discontinued 4 weeks later due to adverse effects. The lesions remained in remission for 2 months while the puppy received clindamycin monotherapy before a second relapse of skin lesions occurred.
   Conclusion and clinical importanceTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first documentation of the treatment and outcome of C. bigenetica cutaneous infection in a dog. Although remission of clinical signs can be achieved with combination therapy of clindamycin and TMS, long-term management is challenging and relapses should be anticipated.

   ObjectifsDecrire la presentation clinique, les donnees histologiques, le traitement et l'evolution d'un cas de dermatite nodulaire et panniculite protozoaire chez un chiot Rottweiler due a C. bigenetica.
   ResultatsLe chiot presentait des nodules sous-cutanes generalises mesurant jusqu'a 2 cm de diametre. L'histopathologie revele une dermatite suppurative a pyogranulomateuse marquee et une panniculite avec des organismes protozoaires intralesionnels. Un sequencage ADN et une PCR ont confirme l'infection a C. bigenetica. Le traitement consistant en une association de trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole (TMS), de yrimethamine et une haute dose de clindamycine (20 mg/kg deux fois par jour) a permis une resolution des lesions en 6 semaines. Un arret du traitement 2 semaines plus tard a ete suivi d'une recidive rapide des lesions cutanees. La clindamycine et la TMS ont ete renouvelees et toutes les lesions se sont resolues en deux semaines; la TMS a ete arretee 4 semaines plus tard en raison d'effets secondaires. Les lesions sont restees en remission pendant 2 mois alors que le chiot recevait de la clindamycine en monotherapie avant qu'une seconde recidive des lesions cutanees ne se developpe.
   Conclusion et importance cliniqueA la connaissance des auteurs, ceci est la premiere description du traitement et de l'evolution d'une infection cutanee a C. bigenetica chez un chien. Bien qu'une remission des signes cliniques puisse etre obtenue avec un traitement combine de clindamycine et TMS, une gestion au long cours est un defi et des recidives doivent etre anticipees.
   Resumen
   IntroduccionCaryospora bigenetica es un parasito protozoario intracelular en serpientes y rapaces (hospedadores primarios) y roedores (hospedadores secundarios). La infeccion experimental se ha descrito en ratones, cerdos y cabras; la infeccion natural en perros es rara.
   Hipotesis/Objetivosdescribir la presentacion clinica, caracteristicas histologicas, tratamiento y resultado del mismo de un caso de dermatitis y paniculitis nodular protozoaria en un cachorro de Rottweiler causada por C. bigenetica.
   Resultadosel cachorro se presento con nodulos subcutaneos midiendo hasta 2 cm de diametro. La histopatologia revelo dermatitis supurativa a piogranulomatosa marcada y paniculitis con protozoos intralesionales. Analisis mediante PCR y secuenciacion de DNA confirmo la infeccion por C. bigenetica. El tratamiento con una combinacion de trimetroprima-sulfametozaxol oral (TMS), vrimetamina y clindamicina a dosis elevadas (20 mg/kg dos veces al dia) resulto en resolucion de las lesiones en 6 semanas. La interrupcion del tratamiento fue seguida de relapso rapido de las lesiones de la piel 2 semanas mas tarde. Se reinicio el tratamiento con clindamicina y TMS y las lesiones se resolvieron en dos semanas; el tratamiento con TMS se interrumpio 4 semanas mas tarde debido a efectos adversos. Las lesiones permanecieron en remision durante 2 meses mientras el cachorro recibia monoterapia de clindamicina antes de producirse un nuevo relapso de las lesiones de la piel.
   Conclusion e importancia clinicaa nuestro entender, este es el primer caso documentado de tratamiento y resultados de infeccion cutanea con C. bigenetica en un perro. Aunque se puede obtener remision de los signos clinicos con tratamiento combinado con clindamicina y TMS, el manejo a largo plazo es complicado y se espera relapso de las lesiones
   Zusammenfassung
   HintergrundCaryospora bigenetica ist ein intrazellularer Parasit der Protozoen, der bei Schlangen und Raubvogeln (primare Wirte) und bei Nagern (sekundare Wirte) vorkommt. Eine experimentelle Infektion konnte bei Mausen, Schweinen und Ziegen dokumentiert werden; eine naturliche Infektion beim Hund ist selten.
   ZieleEine Beschreibung der klinischen Prasentation, der histologischen Merkmale, der Behandlung und des Endergebnisses eines Falles von Protozoen bedingter nodularer Dermatitis und Pannikulitis, die bei einem Rottweilerwelpen durch C. bigenetica verursacht wurde.
   ErgebnisseDer Welpe wurde mit generalisierten subkutanen Knoten im Ausma ss von bis zu 2cm im Durchmesser vorgestellt. Die Histopathologie zeigte eine hochgradige suppurative bis pyogranulomatose Dermatitis und Pannikulitis mit intralasionalen Protozoen. PCR und eine Sequenzierung der DNA bestatigte die Infektion mit C. bigenetica. Eine Behandlung mit einer Kombination aus Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazol (TMS), Yrimethamin und hochdosiertem Clindamycin (20mg/kg zweimal taglich) fuhrten in 6 Wochen zum Verschwinden der Hautveranderungen. Das Absetzen der Medikamente fuhrte 2 Wochen spater zur einem raschen Wiederauftreten der Hautveranderungen. Clindamycin und TMS wurden wieder gegeben und alle Lasionen verschwanden innerhalb von 2 Wochen; aufgrund von Nebenwirkungen wurde TMS 4 Wochen spater abgesetzt. Wahrend der Welpe auf Clindamycin Monotherapie war, blieben die Veranderungen 2 Monate lang in Remission bevor ein nochmaliges Wiederauftreten der Hautveranderungen vorkam.
   Schlussfolgerung und klinische BedeutungNach bestem Wissen der Autoren handelt es sich hier um die erste Dokumentation der Behandlung und des Ergebnisses einer Infektion der Haut durch C. bigenetica bei einem Hund. Obwohl die Remission der klinischen Symptome mit einer Kombinationstherapie von Clindamycin und TM erreicht werden kann, ist ein Langzeitmanagement eine Herausforderung und Ruckfalle sind zu erwarten.

AB Objective: Clinical and research usefulness of articles can depend on image quality. This study addressed whether scans of figures in black and white (B&W), grayscale, or color, or portable document format (PDF) to tagged image file format (TIFF) conversions as provided by interlibrary loan or document delivery were viewed as acceptable or useful by radiologists or pathologists.
   Methods: Residency coordinators selected eighteen figures from studies from radiology, clinical pathology, and anatomic pathology journals. With original PDF controls, each figure was prepared in three or four experimental conditions: PDF conversion to TIFF, and scans from print in B&W, grayscale, and color. Twelve independent observers indicated whether they could identify the features and whether the image quality was acceptable. They also ranked all the experimental conditions of each figure in terms of usefulness.
   Results: Of 982 assessments of 87 anatomic pathology, 83 clinical pathology, and 77 radiology images, 471 (48%) were unidentifiable. Unidentifiability of originals (4%) and conversions (10%) was low. For scans, unidentifiability ranged from 53% for color, to 74% for grayscale, to 97% for B&W. Of 987 responses about acceptability (n=405), 41% were said to be unacceptable, 97% of B&W, 66% of grayscale, 41% of color, and 1% of conversions. Hypothesized order (original, conversion, color, grayscale, B&W) matched 67% of rankings (n=215).
   Conclusions: PDF to TIFF conversion provided acceptable content. Color images are rarely useful in grayscale (12%) or B&W (less than 1%). Acceptability of grayscale scans of noncolor originals was 52%. Digital originals are needed for most images. Print images in color or grayscale should be scanned using those modalities.

AB BackgroundEpidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a rare autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease of dogs and humans.
   ObjectivesOur objectives were to describe clinical phenotypes, histopathology and treatment outcomes of canine EBA.
   AnimalsTwenty dogs diagnosed with EBA based on a subepidermal blister formation and collagen VII autoreactivity.
   ResultsMost dogs were young (median: 1.2-year-old) with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Nine of 20 dogs (45%) developed lesions before one year of age and 11 of 20 dogs (55%) were great danes. Tense vesicles and bullae (18 of 20; 90%) and deep erosions and ulcers (20 of 20; 100%) were the most common lesions and these affected predominantly the oral cavity (19 of 20; 95%), pinnae (16 of 20; 80%), axillae (15 of 20; 75%) and footpads (14 of 20; 70%). Histopathology identified neutrophilic perivascular dermatitis (17 of 17; 100%) without or with (12 of 17; 71%) eosinophils, which occasionally equalled (four cases) or outnumbered neutrophils (two cases). Subepidermal vesicles were either devoid of inflammation or contained neutrophils with or without eosinophils, fibrin and/or haemorrhage. A complete remission of skin lesions was obtained in 14 dogs with a median time of 58 days. Glucocorticoids were used in these dogs either as a monotherapy (3 of 14; 21%) or in combination with other immunomodulating drugs (11 of 14; 79%). The median dose of prednisone was 3 mg/kg/day. The remaining six dogs were euthanized.
   Conclusions and clinical importanceCanine EBA is a rare subepidermal blistering disease with an inflammatory phenotype and a predilection for young great danes and male dogs. The outcome of treatment appears more favourable than assumed previously.

   HintergrundDie Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) ist eine seltene autoimmune subepidermale blasenbildende Erkrankung von Hunden und Menschen.
   ZieleUnsere Ziele waren es, die klinischen Phanotypen, die Histopathologie und die Behandlungserfolge bei der EBA des Hundes zu beschreiben.
   TiereZwanzig Hunde, die mit EBA diagnostiziert worden waren. Die Diagnose beruhte auf der subepidermalen Blasenbildung und der Kollagen VII Autoreaktivitat.
   ErgebnisseDie meisten Hunde waren jung (Median: 1,2 Jahre alt) mit einer mannlich: weiblich Verteilung von 2,3: 1. Neun von 20 Hunden (45%) entwickelten vor dem ersten Lebensjahr Veranderungen und 11 von 20 Hunden (55%) waren Deutsche Doggen. Straffe Vesikel und Blasen (18 von 20; 90%) und tiefe Erosionen und Ulzera (20 von 20; 100%) waren die haufigsten Lasionen und diese betrafen vor allem die Maulhohle (19 von 20; 95%), die Pinnae (16 von 20; 80%), die Achseln (15 von 20; 75%) und die Fu ss ballen (14 von 20; 70%). Die histopathologische Untersuchung ergab eine neutrophile perivaskulare Dermatitis (17 von 17; 100%) ohne und mit (12 von 17; 71%) Eosinophilen, die gelegentlich in gleicher (vier Falle) oder in hoherer Anzahl als die Neutrophilen (zwei Falle) auftraten. Die subepidermalen Vesikel zeigten entweder keine Entzundung oder beinhalteten Neutrophile mit oder ohne Eosinophilen, Fibrin und/oder Blutungen. Eine komplette Remission der Hautveranderungen wurde bei 14 Hunden nach einer medianen Zeit von 58 Tagen erzielt. Bei diesen Hunden wurden Glucocortikoide entweder als Monotherapie (3 von 14; 21%) oder in Kombination mit anderen immunmodulierenden Medikamenten (11 von 14; 79%) eingesetzt. Die mediane Dosis des Prednisolons betrug 3 mg/kg/Tag. Die ubrigen sechs Hunde wurden eingeschlafert.
   Schlussfolgerungen und klinische BedeutungDie EBA des Hundes ist eine seltene subepidermale blaschenbildende Erkrankung mit einem entzundlichen Phanotyp und einer Pradilektion fur junge Deutsche Doggen und mannliche Hunde. Das Ergebnis einer Behandlung scheint prognostisch gunstiger als bisher angenommen.

AB ObjectiveTo describe the clinical, histopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of an equine ocular inflammatory disease resulting in anterior uveitis and corneal endothelial inflammation associated with iris pigment dispersion and retrocorneal fibrous membrane (RFM) formation.
   DesignRetrospective study.
   Animals studiedSixteen horses with evidence of pigmented keratic precipitates (KPs), corneal edema, and/or iris depigmentation. Information collected from the medical records included signalment, clinical signs, prereferral treatment duration and response to therapy, ophthalmic examination findings, postreferral treatment, response to therapy, and outcome.
   ResultsTwenty-one eyes from 16 horses were affected. Age ranged between 9 and 25years (Average 16.1years). Blepharospasm, epiphora, and/or corneal opacification were the first clinical signs noted. At the time of referral pigmented KPs, corneal edema, iridal depigmentation, and retrocorneal membranes were commonly seen. Treatment included topical and/or systemic anti-inflammatories and antibiotics with variable response. Reduction or cessation of anti-inflammatory therapy resulted in worsening of clinical signs and disease progression. Eight eyes ultimately required enucleation. Histopathology changes include iridal pigment loss and dispersion, RFM formation, and keratitis. Variable degrees of lymphoplasmacytic inflammation were dominated by T-cells within the corneal stroma, RFM, iris, and ciliary body with occasional multinucleated giant cells.
   ConclusionsHeterochromic iridocyclitis with secondary keratitis (HIK) is characterized by uveal inflammation with pigment dispersion and suspected corneal endothelial dysfunction. Horses being treated for HIK require diligent and frequent follow-up examinations in combination with aggressive local immune suppression to control the disease. However, HIK may not respond to therapy and enucleation may ultimately be required to ensure the horse's comfort.

AB BackgroundThe diagnosis of dogs with chronic juxtamucosal erosive lesions and histopathology typical of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is unclear.
   Hypothesis/ObjectivesWe report herein 21 dogs with mucocutaneous erosive lesions and lupus-specific histopathology that we propose to be affected with mucocutaneous lupus erythematosus (MCLE), another variant of chronic CLE.
   MethodsInclusion criteria were the presence of the following: (i)a >2month history of chronic or recurrent skin lesions; (ii)erosions or ulcers predominating at mucosae or mucocutaneous junctions; (iii)microscopic lesions of CLE (i.e. a lymphocyte-rich interface dermatitis with basal keratinocyte damage); and (iv)a lack of complete remission following antimicrobials. Clinical questionnaires and skin biopsies were reviewed. Direct immunofluorescence and antinuclear antibody serology were performed whenever possible.
   ResultsMore than half of the 21 dogs were German shepherds or their crosses. The disease affected mostly dogs in their mid-adulthood and there was an over-representation of females. Erosions and ulcers predominated at genital/perigenital and anal/perianal areas, with a lower frequency of involvement of periocular, perioral and perinasal regions. In these dogs, there were no clinical signs suggestive of an associated systemic lupus erythematosus. Microscopic lesions were specific for CLE, but they were patchy and often infected with bacteria. The most common immunological finding was focal IgG deposition at the basement membrane zone. Lesions responded to varying interventions, but oral glucocorticoids led to a shorter time to complete remission. Relapses were common upon treatment tapering.
   Conclusions and clinical importanceThese observations support MCLE being another variant of canine CLE.
   Resumen
   Introduccionel diagnostico de perros con lesiones erosivas cronicas cercanas a la mucosa y con histopatologia tipica de cutaneos lupus eritematoso (CLE) no esta muy claro.
   Hipotesis/Objetivosen este articulo estudiamos 21 casos de perros con lesiones erosivas mucocutaneas y patologia especifica de lupus que proponemos estan afectados con lupus eritematoso mucocutaneo (MCLE), otra variante CLE cronico.
   Metodoslos criterios de inclusion fueron la presencia de los siguientes elementos: i) una historia de mas de dos meses de lesiones recurrentes de la piel cronicas; ii) erosiones y ulceracion predominantemente en las mucosas y uniones mucocutaneas; iii) lesiones microscopicas de cutaneos lupus eritematoso (dermatitis de interfase rica en linfocitos con dano a los queratinocitos basales); y iv) falta de remision completa tras el tratamiento antimicrobiano. Los cuestionarios clinicos y las biopsias de piel fueron revisadas. Se realizo inmunofluorescencia directa y serologia para anticuerpos antinucleares cuando fue posible.
   Resultadosmas de la mitad de los 21 perros fueron Pastores Alemanes o sus cruces. Las enfermedad afecto mayormente a perros de edad adulta media y hubo mayor representacion de hembras. Erosiones y ulceras predominaron en la zona genital/perigenital y zonas anal/perianal, con menor frecuencia en las zonas perioculares, perianales y perinasales. En estos perros no hubo signos clinicos indicativos de lupus eritematoso sistemico. Las lesiones microscopicas fueron especificas para CLE, pero fueron discontinuas y a menudo infectadas con bacterias. El hallazgo inmunologico mas comun fue deposicion focal de IgG en la zona basal. La lesiones respondieron a varias intervenciones, pero la administracion de corticoides por via oral produjo un intervalo mas corto para alcanzar remision completa. Las recidiva fueron frecuentes tras la disminucion progresiva del tratamiento.
   Conclusiones e importancia clinicaestas observaciones apoyan la existencia de MCLE como otra variante de CLE canino.

   Zusammenfassung
   HintergrundDie Diagnose von Hunden mit chronischen juxtamukosalen erosiven Veranderungen und die typische Histopathologie des kutanen Lupus erythematosus (CLE) sind unklar.
   Hypothese/ZieleWir berichten hier von 21 Hunden mit mukokutanen erosiven Veranderungen und einer Lupus-spezifischen Histopathologie, die wir einem mucocutanen Lupus erythematosus (MCLE), einer weiteren Variante von chronischem CLE, zuschreiben.
   MethodenEinschlusskriterien waren das Vorkommen von Folgendem: (i) eine > 2 monatige Anamnese chronischer oder wiederkehrender Hautveranderungen; (ii) Erosionen oder Ulzera, die vor allem an der Mukosa oder den mukokutanen ubergangen auftraten; (iii) mikroskopische Veranderungen von CLE (i.e. eine Lymphozyten-reiche Interface Dermatitis mit basaler Keratinozytenzerstorung); und (iv) das Ausbleiben einer volligen Remission nach Anwendung von Antibiotika. Es wurden klinische Fragebogen und Hautbiopsien reviewed. Eine direkte Immunfluoreszenz und eine Antinukleare Antikorperserologie wurde, wo immer moglich, durchgefuhrt.
   ErgebnisseMehr als die Halfte der 21 Hunde waren Deutsche Schaferhunde oder ihre Mischlinge. Die Krankheit betraf hauptsachlich Hunde mittleren Alters, wobei weibliche Tiere uberreprasentiert waren. Erosionen und Ulzera kamen hauptsachlich genital/perigenital und anal/perianal vor, wobei periokulare, periorale und perinasale Regionen weniger haufig betroffen waren. Bei diesen Hunden gab es keine klinischen Anzeichen, die auf einen Zusammenhang mit einem systemischen Lupus erythematosus hingewiesen hatten. Die mikroskopischen Veranderungen waren typisch fur CLE, kamen aber nur stellenweise vor und waren mit Bakterien infiziert. Der haufigste immunologische Befund war eine fokale Ablagerung von IgG an der Basalmembran. Die Veranderungen reagierten auf die unterschiedlichsten Behandlungen, aber Glukokortikoide per os fuhrten in der kurzesten Zeit zur volligen Remission. Rezidive traten bei ausschleichender Behandlung haufig auf.
   Schlussfolgerungen und klinische BedeutungDiese Beobachtungen unterstutzen die Meinung, dass MCLE eine weitere Variante des caninen CLE darstellt.

AB Canine cutaneous histiocytoma (CCH) is a common, benign neoplastic proliferation of histiocytes of Langerhans cell origin that often ulcerate, become secondarily infected and regress spontaneously. Bartonella is a fastidious genus of facultative intracellular pathogens that can be transmitted through arthropod bites and epidermal animal scratches and has been identified previously in the cytoplasm of histiocytes within granulomatous lesions and in skin biopsy samples of inflammatory pustules and papules. Based on the established inflammatory and oncogenic properties of Bartonella, we hypothesized that Bartonella spp. DNA could be amplified from CCH more often than from non-lesional skin and bacteria could be localized within skin tumours using indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Paraffin wax-embedded surgical biopsy samples from dogs with CCH and non-neoplastic skin adjacent to osteosarcomas (control group selected due to wide surgical margins) were retrieved from the archive of the pathology service of North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine. DNA was extracted and regions of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the pap31 and gltA genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Bartonella-specific primers. IIF was performed using a primary Bartonella henselae monoclonal antibody to localize B. henselae in tissues of PCR-positive dogs. Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii was amplified from 1/17 (5.8%) control tissues and B. henselae was amplified from 4/29 (13.8%) CCH tissues. The prevalence of B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii (P = 0.37) or B. henselae (P = 0.28) did not vary statistically between study groups. B. henselae could be visualized in 2/4 (50.0%) CCH tissues using IIF. Based on this study, Bartonella spp. are unlikely to cause CCH. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Dinotefuran/pyriproxyfen/permethrin pemphigus-like drug reaction in
   three dogs
SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FOLIACEUS
AB BackgroundPemphigus foliaceus (PF) can occur spontaneously or as a reaction pattern associated with cutaneous adverse drug reactions.
   Hypothesis/ObjectivesTo provide clinical, histological and immunological assessments of three dogs that developed cutaneous adverse drug reactions following application of a topical flea and tick control product, which contained dinotefuran, pyriproxyfen and permethrin.
   AnimalsThree client-owned dogs.
   ResultsThe dogs exhibited rapid onset of papules, pustules and crusts at the site of application of the flea control product. In two dogs, the lesions became generalized, while the third exhibited a localized phenotype. Both dogs with generalized lesions required immunosuppressive treatment; one achieved remission after 1year of treatment and one was euthanized due to adverse effects of glucocorticoids. The dog with a localized phenotype was treated with topical glucocorticoids exclusively and achieved remission after 10months. Histology revealed subcorneal pustular dermatitis, with acantholysis of keratinocytes and focal to multifocal full-thickness epidermal necrosis. These features are similar to those previously reported for pesticide-triggered and spontaneous PF. Tissue-bound IgG was detected in two of three dogs, and autoantibodies targeting canine desmocollin-1 were identified in the serum of the one dog from which a sample was available.
   Conclusions and clinical importanceCutaneous adverse drug reaction caused by a flea control product containing dinotefuran, pyriproxyfen and permethrin closely resembled those reported for other pesticide-associated PF-like cutaneous adverse drug reactions. Although it appears to be a rare entity, clinicians and pathologists should be aware of the potential for flea and tick control products to trigger PF-like reactions.

   Tetracycline and Niacinamide Therapy
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ANIMAL HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION

DT Article
ID DOGS; PEMPHIGUS
AB Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a commonly reported canine autoimmune disease that normally presents with a phenotype consisting of erythema, depigmentation, scaling, erosions/ulcers, and scarring over the nasal planum and the proximal dorsal muzzle. Recently, two cases of a generalized variant of this disease have been reported, whose lesions responded to either systemic glucocorticoids or a combination of topical corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus, and the oral antimalarial hydroxychloroquine. The purpose of this report is to describe an 11 yr old shih tzu that presented with skin lesions consisting of multiple annular, erythematous papules and plaques, hyperpigmentation, adherent scaling, and atrophic scars over the caudal dorsum, flanks, craniodorsal thorax, and lateroproximal extremities. A diagnosis of generalized DLE was made based on the clinical presentation, histopathology, laboratory values, and direct immunofluorescence findings. Treatment consisted of oral tetracycline and oral niacinamide, which resulted in complete remission of clinical signs. This is the first documented report of generalized canine DLE responding to the described immunomodulating regimen. Such a combination might therefore be considered as a glucocorticoid and/or antimalarial alternative for the management of generalized DLE.

AB Canine toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN), a rare and life-threatening cutaneous drug reaction, traditionally has been described as full-thickness devitalization of the epidermis with minimal dermal inflammation; however, few reports detail the histologic findings. We characterize the clinical features and histologic variations of 3 canine TEN patients. Clinically, irregular erythematous and purpuric macules evolved into widespread and severely painful erosions. The number of eroded mucosae varied; however, periocular and perilabial mucocutaneous junctions frequently were affected. Thirteen of 17 biopsies were evaluated. Apoptosis at multiple epidermal levels was the most common pattern of epidermal necrosis (12/13 biopsies, 92%). In contrast, full-thickness coagulation necrosis was present less often (7/13 biopsies, 52%). Lymphocytic interface dermatitis was the predominant inflammatory pattern, and intraepidermal lymphocytes, along with fewer histiocytes, were present to some degree in all samples along with lymphocytic satellitosis of apoptotic keratinocytes. The sequence of changes points to lymphocyte-mediated keratinocyte apoptosis as an early step in lesion development with subsequent variation in progression to coagulation necrosis among patients. Histopathologic changes overlapped with those reported for erythema multiforme, in contrast to traditional histologic descriptions of canine TEN. A specific algorithm for assessment of drug causality in epidermal necrolysis (ALDEN) was applied for each patient; carprofen was associated with a probable score for causality in 1 dog. Clinicians should be encouraged to take multiple biopsies in TEN suspect cases as nearly 25% of all biopsies lacked epithelium and were not diagnostic.

TI Concurrent Bartonella henselae infection in a dog with panniculitis and

LA English
DT Article
ID DISEASE; USA
AB BackgroundBartonella henselae, a Gram-negative, zoonotic Alphaproteobacteria that infects erythrocytes, endothelial cells and dendritic cells, has previously been implicated as a cause of panniculitis in dogs and a human.
   Animal and ownerAn 8-year-old, spayed female Labrador retriever and its 78-year-old male owner living in the same household.
   Methods and resultsWhen preliminary and advanced testing failed to identify the cause of near-simultaneous-onset dermatological lesions, Bartonella serology, Bartonella Alphaproteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM) enrichment blood culture/PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to test specimens from the dog and owner. Bartonella henselae, genotype San Antonio2 DNA was amplified and sequenced from the man's BAPGM enrichment blood culture and the dog's panniculitis lesion. The bacterium was visualized by immunohistochemistry in the dog's panniculitis lesion; however, neither the dog nor the owner was B.henselae seroreactive. Antibiotic therapy elicited dermatological improvement in both dog and owner.
   Conclusions and clinical importanceBartonella henselae is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that induces granulomatous inflammatory lesions in various tissues of animals, including humans. We conclude that this bacterium had a contributory or causative role in the development of the dermatological lesions in the dog and owner.

   Resumen
   IntroduccionBartonella henselae, una alfaproteobacteria zoonotica y Gram negativa que infecta los eritrocitos, las celulas endoteliales y las celulas dendriticas ha sido implicada previamente como una causa de paniculitis en perros y en un paciente humano.
   Animal y duenouna perra esterilizada de ocho anos de edad de raza Labrador Retriever y su propietario de 78 anos de edad que vivian en la misma casa.
   Metodos y resultadoscuando pruebas preliminares y mas avanzadas fallaron para identificar la causa de lesiones dermatologicas de aparicion casi simultanea, se utilizaron serologia para Bartonella, medio de crecimiento de Bartonella alfaproteobacteria (BAPGM) enriquecido con sangre/ PCR e inmunohistoquimica para estudiar las muestras del perro y del propietario. DNA de Bartonella henselae, genotipo San Antonio 2 fue amplificado y secuenciado de las placas de cultivo de las muestras del ser humano enriquecidas con sangre, y de la lesion de paniculitis del perro. La bacteria se visualizo mediante inmunohistoquimica en la lesion de paniculitis del perro, sin embargo ni el perro ni propietario fueron reactivos para Bartonella henselae. El tratamiento antibiotico produjo una mejora dermatologica tanto en el perro como en sul propietario.
   Conclusiones e importancia clinicaBartonella henselae es un patogeno emergente zoonotico que produce lesiones inflamatorias granulomatosas en varios tejidos animales, incluidos los humanos. Concluimos que esta bacteria es una causa contribuyente o causal para el desarrollo de lesiones dermatologicas en el perro y en su propietario.
   Zusammenfassung
   HintergrundBartonella henselae, ein Gram-negatives zoonotisches Alphaproteobakterium, welches Erythrozyten, Endothelzellen und dendritische Zellen infiziert, wurde schon einmal als Ursache fur eine Pannikulitis bei Hunden und bei einem menschlichen Patienten in Erwagung gezogen.
   Tier und BesitzerEine 8 Jahre alte kastrierte Labrador Retrieverhundin und deren 78 Jahre alter Besitzer, die im selben Haushalt leben.
   Methoden und ErgebnisseNachdem Vor- und spezielle Untersuchungen die Ursache fur einen fast gleichzeitigen Beginn von Hautveranderungen nicht klaren konnten, wurde Bartonella Serologie, eine mit Bartonella Alphaproteobakterium Wachstumsmedium (BAPGM) angereicherte Blutkultur/PCR und Immunhistochemie angewendet, um die Erreger bei Hund und Besitzer zu untersuchen. Bartonella henselae, Genotyp San Antonio 2 DNA wurde aus der BAPGM angereicherten Blutkultur des Besitzers und aus den Pannikulitis Veranderungen des Hundes amplifiziert und sequenziert; nichtsdestotrotz reagierte weder das Serum des Hundes noch des Besitzers positiv auf B. henselae. Eine antibiotische Therapie bewirkte sowohl beim Hund als auch beim Besitzer eine Verbesserung der Haut.
   Schlussfolgerungen und klinische BedeutungBartonella henselae ist ein aufkommendes zoonotisches Pathogen, welches granulomatose entzundliche Reaktionen in verschiedenen Geweben von Tieren und Menschen auslost. Wir schlie ss en daraus, dass dieses Bakterium bei der Entstehung von Hautveranderungen dieses Hundes und des Besitzers eine begleitende oder ursachliche Rolle spielte.

ID DOGS
AB BackgroundGeneralized discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is an autoimmune skin disease variant rarely reported in dogs. The antimalarial immunomodulator hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as maintenance therapy for generalized DLE in one dog, but several recurrences were noted in the 1year follow-up of that patient.
   Hypothesis/ObjectiveTo describe the effective treatment of generalized DLE with ciclosporin in one dog.
   AnimalA 6-year-old, castrated male crossbred dog was presented with pruritic, well-demarcated annular to polycyclic, hyperpigmented plaques with marginal erythema on the dorsal head, neck, trunk and medial extremities; these had been nonresponsive to treatment with doxycycline and niacinamide.
   MethodsInvestigation included complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, urinalysis, serum antinuclear antibody test, histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence testing of skin biopsies.
   ResultsThe presence of lymphocyte-rich interface dermatitis on histology, together with generalized chronic recurrent hyperpigmented plaques, was consistent with the diagnosis of a generalized variant of DLE. The absence of systemic signs and unremarkable laboratory tests excluded concurrent systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment was initiated with oral dexamethasone and ciclosporin. After 1month, dexamethasone was discontinued and oral ketoconazole was added to the therapeutic regimen. Four months later, pruritus and erythema resolved, with most skin lesions becoming impalpable. Over the last 6months, the patient's DLE was maintained in remission with oral ciclosporin and ketoconazole in combination every 3days.
   Conclusions and clinical importanceThe combination of ciclosporin and ketoconazole appeared effective to induce and maintain lesion remission in this dog with generalized DLE.

   Resumen
   Introduccionel lupus eritematoso discoide generalizado (DLE) es una enfermedad autoinmune de la piel raramente descrita en perros. Se ha sugerido que el inmunomodulador antimalaria hidroxicloroquina puede utilizarse como terapia de mantenimiento para DLE generalizado en un perro, pero se observaron recidivas en el ano de seguimiento del paciente.
   Hipotesis/Objetivosdescribir el tratamiento efectivo de disco DLE generalizado en un perro.
   Animalesun macho castrado de seis anos de raza mixta se presento con lesiones tipo placas anulares, a policiclicas, bien demarcadas e hiperpigmentadas que presentaban eritema marginal y que estaban localizadas en la parte dorsal de la cabeza, cuello, tronco, y parte media de las extremidades. Estas habian respondido al tratamiento con doxiciclina y niacinamida.
   Metodosla investigacion incluyo hematologia, bioquimica sanguinea, urianalisis, la prueba de anticuerpos antinucleares en el suero, el examen histopatologico, y la inmunofluorescencia directa de la piel.
   Resultadosla presencia de dermatitis en interfase con numerosos linfocitos en las preparaciones histologicas, junto con la presencia de placas hiperpigmentadas cronicas recidivantes, fue consistente con un diagnostico de la variante generalizada de DEL. La ausencia de signos sistemicos y la ausencia de pruebas anormales de laboratorio excluyeron la posibilidad de lupus eritematoso sistemico. El tratamiento se inicio con dexametasona oral y ciclosporina. Tras un mes de tratamiento, se discontinuo la dexametasona y se anadio quetoconazol por via oral al regimen terapeutico, cuatro meses mas tarde, el prurito y el eritema habian resuelto y la mayoria de las lesiones de la piel no se detectaron por palpacion. En los seis meses siguientes al paciente se mantuvo en remision con ciclosporina oral y quetoconazol en combinacion administrados cada tres dias.
   Conclusiones e importancia clinicala combinacion de ciclosporina y quetoconazol parece ser efectiva para inducir y mantener la remision de las lesiones en este perro con DLE generalizado.
   Zusammenfassung
   HintergrundDer generalisierte diskoide Lupus erythematosus (DLE) ist eine Variante der autoimmunen Hauterkrankung, die bei Hunden selten beschrieben wird. Der antimalarische Immunmodulator Hydrxychloroquin wurde als Erhaltungstherapie fur einen generalisierten DLE bei einem Hund vorgeschlagen, wobei es aber innerhalb des Follow-Ups von einem Jahr zum mehrmaligen Wiederauftreten der Krankheit kam.
   Hypothese/ZieleDie Beschreibung einer wirksamen Behandlung eines generalisierten DLE bei einem Hund mit Ciclosporin.
   TierEin sechs Jahre alter kastrierter Mischlingsrude wurde mit juckenden, gut abgegrenzten annularen bis polyzyklischen, hyperpigmentierten Plaques mit erythematosem Rand am dorsalen Kopf, Nacken, Rumpf und den medialen Extremitaten vorgestellt; diese Veranderungen hatten sich durch die Behandlung mit Doxycyclin und Niacinamid nicht verbessert.
   MethodenDie Untersuchung beinhaltete ein Blutbild, eine Serumbiochemie, eine Urinanalyse, einen Antinuklearen Antikorpertest im Serum, eine histopathologische Untersuchung und einen direkten Immunfluoreszenztest der Hautbiopsien.
   ErgebnisseDas histologische Auftreten einer Lymphozyten-reichen Interface Dermatitis zusammen mit generalisierten chronisch wiederkehrenden hyperpigmentierten Plaques war mit der Diagnose einer generalisierten Variante des DLE im Einklang. Durch die Abwesenheit systemischer Symptomatik und den unergiebigen Labortests konnte ein begleitender systemischer Lupus erythematosus ausgeschlossen werden. Es wurde eine Behandlung mit Dexamethason und Ciclosporin per os eingeleitet. Nach einem Monat wurde das Dexamethason abgesetzt und Ketokonazol per os wurde zum Therapieplan hinzugefugt. Vier Monate spater waren Juckreiz und Erythem verschwunden, die meisten Hautveranderungen konnte man nicht mehr ertasten. Im Verlauf der letzten sechs Monate konnte der DLE dieses Patienten mit der kombinierten Verabreichung von Ciclosporin und Ketokonazol alle drei Tage in Remission gehalten werden.
   Schlussfolgerungen und klinische BedeutungDie Kombination von Ciclosporin und Ketokonazol zeigte bei diesem Hund mit generalisiertem DLE sowohl bei der Behandlung der Hautveranderungen wie auch bei Erhaltung in Remission ihre Wirksamkeit.

AB Objective: To radiographically and histologically evaluate the effects of photodynamic therapy on the cisterna chyli in rats.
   Study Design: Experimental study.
   Animals: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 60).
   Methods: Cecal lymph nodes were injected with the photodynamic compound verteporfin. A 690 nm, 500mW diode laser was then directed at the area of the cisterna chyli for either 0, 1.5, or 3 minutes. Cisterna chyli patency was evaluated using lymphography, and histologic changes were evaluated on postoperative Days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14.
   Results: Histologically, minimal to marked injury to the cisternal and/or pericisternal tissues was present in all treated rats at all time periods. Radiographically, 8/20 cisternae were occluded in the 1.5-minute treatment group (including 1/4 on Day 1, 2/4 on Day 3, 3/4 on Day 5, 0/4 on Day 7, and 2/4 on Day 14), and 9/20 cisternae were occluded in the 3-minute treatment group (including 0/4 on Day 1, 1/4 on Day 3, 3/4 on Day 5, 3/4 on Day 7, and 2/4 on Day 14). There was minimal to no histologic evidence of tissue injury in control rats. All control cisternae were radiographically open.
   Conclusions: Further investigations into the timing of laser application and light dose, or alternative photodynamic agents are required to limit injury to adjacent tissues and to improve the effectiveness of cisternal photoablation.

   Background
   A recently launched topical ectoparasiticide containing fipronil, amitraz and S-methoprene has been associated with the development of an acantholytic pustular dermatitis similar to that of Promeris-triggered pemphigus foliaceus (PF). Hypothesis/Objectives
   Our objectives were to describe the clinical, histological and immunological features of this PF-like cutaneous adverse drug reaction. Animals
   Twenty-one dogs with a probable or definitive diagnosis of PF-like cutaneous adverse drug reaction were identified between May 2012 and February 2013. Material and Methods
   Histology, direct and indirect immunofluorescence were employed to address the study objectives. Results
   Most dogs were middle-aged or older (median, 9 years) and of large size (median, 23 kg). In six dogs (29%), the PF-like lesions remained confined to the site of application, while 15 dogs (71%) exhibited lesions at distant sites. One or two applications of the ectoparasiticide were sufficient to trigger PF-like lesions in seven (33%) and six (29%) dogs, respectively. Systemic signs were reported in nine dogs (43%), all with lesions extending to sites distant from application areas. Tissue-bound antikeratinocyte IgG was detected in the lesional epidermis of eight of 19 (42%) cases by direct immunofluorescence, while serum antikeratinocyte IgG was detected in 10 of 14 (71%) cases by indirect immunofluorescence. Autoantibodies were found to target canine desmocollin-1 in 11 of 14 dogs (79%), but not canine desmoglein-1, by indirect immunofluorescence on transfected cells. These immunological findings were similar in cases with localized and distant disease. Conclusions and clinical importance
   This new topical ectoparasiticide containing fipronil, amitraz and S-methoprene is capable of triggering the development of an acantholytic pustular dermatosis that is a clinical, histological and immunological close match for Promeris-triggered PF and naturally occurring autoimmune PF in dogs.

AB Old English Sheepdogs and Gordon Setters suffer from a juvenile onset, autosomal recessive form of canine hereditary ataxia primarily affecting the Purkinje neuron of the cerebellar cortex. The clinical and histological characteristics are analogous to hereditary ataxias in humans. Linkage and genome-wide association studies on a cohort of related Old English Sheepdogs identified a region on CFA4 strongly associated with the disease phenotype. Targeted sequence capture and next generation sequencing of the region identified an A to C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 113 in exon 1 of an autophagy gene, RAB24, that segregated with the phenotype. Genotyping of six additional breeds of dogs affected with hereditary ataxia identified the same polymorphism in affected Gordon Setters that segregated perfectly with phenotype. The other breeds tested did not have the polymorphism. Genome-wide SNP genotyping of Gordon Setters identified a 1.9 MB region with an identical haplotype to affected Old English Sheepdogs. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural evaluation of the brains of affected dogs from both breeds identified dramatic Purkinje neuron loss with axonal spheroids, accumulation of autophagosomes, ubiquitin positive inclusions and a diffuse increase in cytoplasmic neuronal ubiquitin staining. These findings recapitulate the changes reported in mice with induced neuron-specific autophagy defects. Taken together, our results suggest that a defect in RAB24, a gene associated with autophagy, is highly associated with and may contribute to canine hereditary ataxia in Old English Sheepdogs and Gordon Setters. This finding suggests that detailed investigation of autophagy pathways should be undertaken in human hereditary ataxia.
   Author Summary
   Neurodegenerative diseases are one of the most important causes of decline in an aging population. An important subset of these diseases are known as the hereditary ataxias, familial neurodegenerative diseases that affect the cerebellum causing progressive gait disturbance in both humans and dogs. We identified a mutation in RAB24, a gene associated with autophagy, in Old English Sheepdogs and Gordon Setters with hereditary ataxia. Autophagy is a process by which cell proteins and organelles are removed and recycled and its critical role in maintenance of the continued health of cells is becoming clear. We evaluated the brains of affected dogs and identified accumulations of autophagosomes within the cerebellum, suggesting a defect in the autophagy pathway. Our results suggest that a defect in the autophagy pathway results in neuronal death in a naturally occurring disease in dogs. The autophagy pathway should be investigated in human hereditary ataxia and may represent a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB The lack of a suitable infection model remains an important obstacle for the pathophysiological understanding of Bartonella spp. The following pilot study was designed to determine whether cell culture-grown Bartonella henselae SA2 and Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genotype III would cause persistent bacteremia in dogs. Pre-inoculation screening established that two laboratory-raised Golden retrievers were naturally-infected with Bartonella koehlerae. Despite prior infection, one dog each was inoculated subcutaneously with 5 x 10(4) B. henselae (SA2 strain) or 3 x 10(4) B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genotype III. Dogs were bled weekly for serological testing and culture using Bartonella alpha proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM) diagnostic platform. Dog 1 seroconverted to B. henselae and Dog 2 seroconverted to B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genotype III. Throughout the study period, Bartonella spp. DNA was neither amplified nor isolated in ante-mortem BAPGM enrichment blood cultures. B. henselae SA2 was isolated from a postmortem bone marrow from Dog 1 and B. koehlerae DNA was amplified from postmortem lung from Dog 2 following BAPGM enrichment culture. Limitations include lack of uninfected controls, a potentially suboptimal B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii inoculum and a relatively short duration of study. We conclude that following intradermal infection, sequestration of Bartonella spp. in tissues may limit diagnostic detection of these bacteria in dog blood samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI Cat scratch-induced Pasteurella multocida necrotizing cellulitis in a
   dog
SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INFECTION; FASCIITIS; BITE
AB Background - In humans, rapidly developing Pasteurella multocida cellulitis after a cat scratch or bite is a well-known entity that sometimes progresses to necrotizing fasciitis and can be fatal.
   Case report - A 3-year-old female spayed whippet dog developed ecchymosis, swelling and pain within 24 h of being scratched by a cat on the ventral thorax. Over the following days, while being treated only with pain medications, the lesions rapidly progressed into haemorrhagic bullae with expanding skin necrosis. A heavy growth of P. multocida was seen on bacterial cultures, and histological examination showed marked, suppurative panniculitis with necrosis of the epidermis, dermis and panniculus. Special histological stains highlighted a moderate amount of Gram-negative coccobacilli admixed with inflammatory cells. Complete resolution was achieved with surgical debridement, skin grafting and intravenous antibiotic treatment. Positive bacterial culture for P. multocida, in conjunction with the history, clinical findings, histology results and the rapid response to therapy, strongly supports a diagnosis of P. multocida necrotizing cellulitis.
   Conclusions and clinical importance - Complications of cat bite-associated P. multocida infections in humans are well known. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first documentation of P. multocida necrotizing cellulitis in a dog following a cat scratch wound. This case highlights the rapidity and severity of P. multocida cellulitis, if not recognized and treated early. Veterinarians should include P. multocida in the differential diagnosis of any local wound infection following a cat scratch.

SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY

ID METABOLIC EPIDERMAL NECROSIS; 2 DOGS; DERMATITIS; HEPATOPATHY; NEOPLASMS
AB Background - In humans, necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is a syndrome with a characteristic skin rash that is associated most often with a pancreatic glucagonoma and is recognized as part of the glucagonoma syndrome. In veterinary medicine, NME (also called as superficial necrolytic dermatitis, hepatocutaneous syndrome or metabolic epidermal necrosis) has been described in dogs in association with chronic liver diseases or, less frequently, glucagonoma, but NME associated with glucagonoma has not previously been reported in cats.
   Case report - A 6-year-old male neutered domestic short hair cat was diagnosed with NME associated with a glucagon-producing primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (hepatic carcinoid). The cat presented with a 2 week history of vomiting and anorexia, and a 5-cm-diameter liver mass was detected by abdominal ultrasound. The cat exhibited general weakness, crusted skin lesions and pain in all four limbs. It was euthanized 11 months after the initial presentation. Histopathological review of the paw pads revealed the classic 'red, white and blue' lesion composed of parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, epidermal hydropic change and hyperbasophilia of the deep epidermis. The liver mass was diagnosed as a neuroendocrine carcinoma (hepatic carcinoid). Neoplastic cells were strongly immunoreactive for glucagon.
   Conclusion and clinical importance - This is the first case report of NME associated with a glucagon-producing primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma in a cat.

AB An adult castrated male Doberman Pinscher was presented with a 6-month history of well-demarcated alopecic patches with reticulated hyperpigmentation and fine peripheral scaling on the axillae, thorax, abdomen, inguinal region, and thighs. The dog later developed hyperthermia, lethargy, apparent joint pain, peripheral lymphadenomegaly, vomiting, and diarrhea. Relevant laboratory tests results included anemia, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, and an elevated antinuclear antibodies serum titer. Histologically, skin biopsy specimens had a lymphocyte-rich interface dermatitis and interface mural folliculitis ending in follicular destruction. Altogether, these signs were consistent with a unique alopecic variant of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, eventually associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. This rare form of chronic cutaneous lupus needs to be added to the expanding list of lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune alopecias in dogs.

AB Angiogenesis is an important physiological and pathological process. Bartonella is the only genus of bacteria known to induce pathological angiogenesis in the mammalian host. Bartonella-induced angiogenesis leads to the formation of vascular tumors including verruga peruana and bacillary angiomatosis. The mechanism of Bartonella-induced angiogenesis is not completely understood. Pericytes, along with endothelial cells, play an important role in physiological angiogenesis, and their role in tumor angiogenesis has been extensively studied. Abnormal signaling between endothelial cells and pericytes contributes to tumor angiogenesis and metastasis; however, the role of pericytes in Bartonella-induced angiogenesis is not known. In this study, after infecting human brain vascular pericytes (HBVPs) with Bartonella henselae, we found that these bacteria were able to invade HBVPs and that bacterial infection resulted in decreased pericyte proliferation and increased pericyte production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) when compared to the uninfected control cells. In the context of pathological angiogenesis, reduced pericyte coverage, accompanied by increased VEGF production, may promote endothelial cell proliferation and the formation of new vessels.

AB In his homage to Lucretius ('Georgica'), Vergil is credited with stating: 'Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas' ('Fortunate is he who knows the causes of things'). Based on numerous commentaries and publications it is obvious that clinicians, diagnosticians and biomedical research scientists continue to struggle with disease causation, particularly in the assessment of the pathogenic role of 'stealth pathogens' that produce persistent infections in the host. Bartonella species, because of their evolutionary ability to induce persistent intravascular infections, present substantial challenges for researchers attempting to clarify the ability of these stealth bacteria to cause disease. By studying the comparative biological and pathological behaviour of microbes across mammalian genera, researchers might be able more rapidly to advance medical science and, subsequently, patient care by undertaking focused research efforts involving a single mammalian species or by attempting to recapitulate a complex disease in an rodent model. Therefore, in an effort to further assist in the establishment of disease causation by stealth pathogens, we use recent research observations involving the genus Bartonella to propose an additional postulate of comparative infectious disease causation to Koch's postulates.

TI Validation of a novel epicutaneous delivery system for patch testing of

AB Background Patch tests with allergens are used for the evaluation of cellular hypersensitivity to food and environmental allergens in dogs and humans with atopic dermatitis. Viaskin is a novel allergen epicutaneous delivery system that enhances epidermal allergen capture by immune cells.
   Objectives To compare the use of Viaskin and Finn chamber patch tests in dogs hypersensitive to mite allergens.
   Methods Empty control or Dermatophagoides farinae house dust mite-containing Viaskin or Finn chamber patches were applied to the thoracic skin of six mite-hypersensitive Maltese-beagle crossbred atopic dogs. Lesions were graded 49 and 72 h after patch test application, and skin biopsies were collected after 72 h. Overall microscopic inflammation, eosinophil and T-lymphocyte infiltrations were scored. Results Positive macroscopic patch test reactions developed at five of six Viaskin application sites and four of six Finn chamber application sites. Median microscopic epidermal and dermal inflammation, as well as eosinophil and CD3 T-lymphocyte dermal scores were always higher in biopsies collected at Viaskin than at Finn chamber sites. Microscopic inflammation scores were significantly higher after mite allergen-containing Viaskin compared with empty patches, but this was not the case for mite-containing Finn chambers compared with control chambers. Scores obtained using Viaskin were not significantly different from those obtained using Finn chambers. Macroscopic and microscopic scores were significantly correlated.
   Conclusions and clinical importance In mite-allergic dogs, Viaskin epicutaneous delivery systems appear to induce stronger allergen-specific inflammation than currently used Finn chamber patch tests. Consequently, Viaskin patches might offer a better alternative for screening cellular hypersensitivity to food and environmental allergens.

AB A hereditary cerebellar degenerative disorder has emerged in Scottish Terriers. The aims of this study were to describe and quantify polyglucosan body accumulation and quantify Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum of affected and control dogs. The brains of 6 affected Scottish Terriers ranging in age from 8 to 15 years and 8 age-matched control dogs were examined histopathologically. Counts of Purkinje neurons and polyglucosan bodies were performed in control and affected dogs on cerebellar sections stained with periodic acid-Schiff. Affected dogs showed a significant loss of Purkinje neurons compared with control dogs (vermis: P < .0001; hemisphere: P = .0104). The degeneration was significantly more pronounced dorsally than ventrally (P < .0001). There were significantly more polyglucosan bodies in the ventral half of the vermis when compared with the dorsal half (P < .0001) in affected dogs. In addition, there were more polyglucosan bodies in the ventral half of the vermis in affected dogs than in control dogs (P = .0005). Polyglucosan bodies in all affected dogs stained positively with toluidine blue and alcian blue. Immunohistochemically, polyglucosan bodies in affected dogs were positive for neurofilament 200 kD and ubiquitin and negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin, neurospecific enolase, vimentin, and S100; the bodies were negative for all antigens in control dogs. Ultrastructurally, polyglucosan bodies in 1 affected dog were non-membrane-bound, amorphous structures with a dense core. This study demonstrates significant Purkinje cell loss and increased polyglucosan bodies in the cerebellum of affected Scottish Terriers.

AB Bartonella species are highly fastidious, vector borne, zoonotic bacteria that cause persistent intraerythrocytic bacteremia and endotheliotropic infection in reservoir and incidental hosts. Based upon prior in vitro research, three Bartonella sp., B. bacilliformis, B. henselae, and B. quintana can induce proliferation of endothelial cells, and each species has been associated with in vivo formation of vasoproliferative tumors in human patients. In this study, we report the molecular detection of B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, B. henselae, B. koehlerae, or DNA of two of these Bartonella species simultaneously in vasoproliferative hemangiopericytomas from a dog, a horse, and a red wolf and in systemic reactive angioendotheliomatosis lesions from cats and a steer. In addition, we provide documentation that B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii infections induce activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 and production of vascular endothelial growth factor, thereby providing mechanistic evidence as to how these bacteria could contribute to the development of vasoproliferative lesions. Based upon these results, we suggest that a fourth species, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, should be added to the list of bartonellae that can induce vasoproliferative lesions and that infection with one or more Bartonella sp. may contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic reactive angioendotheliomatosis and hemangiopericytomas in animals.

   MECHANISM; DIAGNOSIS
AB The urinary bladder is a common site of bacterial infection with a majority of cases attributed to uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Sequelae of urinary tract infections (UTIs) include the loss of urothelial barrier function and subsequent clinical morbidity secondary to the permeation of urine potassium, urea and ammonia into the subepithelium. To date there has been limited research describing the mechanism by which this urothelial permeability defect develops. The present study models acute uropathogenic E. coli infection in vitro using intact canine bladder mucosa mounted in Ussing chambers to determine whether infection induces primarily a transcellular or paracellular permeability defect. The Ussing chamber sustains tissue viability while physically separating submucosal and lumen influences, so this model is ideal for quantitative measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) to assess alterations of urothelial barrier function. Using this model, changes in both tissue ultrastructure and TER indicated that uropathogenic E. colt infection promotes a paracellular permeability defect associated with the failure of umbrella cell tight junction formation and umbrella cell sloughing. In addition, bacterial interaction with the urothelium promoted secretion of cytokines from the urinary bladder with bioactivity capable of modulating epithelial barrier function including tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-15. IL-15 secretion by the infected bladder mucosa is a novel finding and, because IL-15 plays key roles in reconstitution of tight junction function in damaged intestine, this study points to a potential role for IL-15 in UTI-induced urothelial injury.

AB Most cats infected with Bartonella henselae remain outwardly healthy carriers for years; however, self-limiting fever, transient anemia, neurologic dysfunction, lymphadenopathy, reproductive disorders, aortic valvular endocarditis, and neutrophilic myocarditis have been described in experimentally or naturally infected cats. Two cats in a North Carolina shelter died with pyogranulomatous myocarditis and diaphragmatic myositis. Bacteria were visualized in the lesions by Warthin-Starry silver impregnation and by B. henselae immunohistochemistry. B. henselae DNA was amplified and sequenced from the heart of 1 cat and from multiple tissue samples, including heart and diaphragm, from the second cat. This study supports a potential association between B. henselae and what has been historically described as "transmissible myocarditis and diaphragmitis" of undetermined cause in cats.

AB The suspensory ligament is difficult to image accurately, partly because it contains ligamentous fibers, as well as noncollagenous adipose and muscle tissue in the normal horse. Our hypothesis was that magnetic resonance (MR) imaging would be more accurate than ultrasonography in identifying the size of the suspensory ligament and the presence and size of noncollagenous tissues within the ligament. Eleven horses were used for ultrasonographic and MR imaging and histologic evaluation of the rear suspensory ligament. The origin and body of the normal suspensory ligament had a heterogenous appearance on MR images with two separate islands of mixed signal intensity evident throughout its otherwise hypointense cross-sectional area. Histologically, there were isolated islands of muscle, adipose, loose connective tissue and dense collagenous partitions, organized in two separate bundles that extended through the full length of the suspensory ligament origin and body to the level of its bifurcation. Comparison of MR images with corresponding histologic sections confirmed that islands of heterogenous signal intensity in normal suspensory ligaments correlated well with these bundles. Using ultrasonography, it was impossible to distinguish these islands from surrounding dense collagenous tissue consistently. MR imaging determined the cross-sectional area of the suspensory ligament more accurately than ultrasonography. Based upon these results, MR imaging is superior to ultrasonography for assessment of the suspensory ligament. The appearance associated with normal ligament anatomy needs to be understood before MR signal variation can be considered as indicative of disease in the suspensory ligament.

TI Surgical treatment of a pulmonary artery vascular hamartoma in a dog
SO JAVMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ADULT DOG
AB Case Description-A 6-year-old Siberian Husky mix dog was examined for episodes of collapse.
   Clinical Findings-Physical examination, echocardiography, abdominal ultrasonography, ECG, and thoracic computed tomography with contrast were performed and revealed a 2.5 X 2.3 X 2.0-cm mass over the pulmonic valve leaflets, resulting in moderate pulmonic stenosis. Other abnormal findings included systemic hypertension, right bundle branch block, proteinuria, and a urinary bladder mass.
   Treatment and Outcome-Pulmonary arteriotomy was performed under inflow occlusion, and the mass was resected with transesophageal echocardiographic guidance and direct visualization. Results of histologic examination of the mass revealed a vascular hamartoma. Sequential follow-up examinations and telephone contacts (at 0.5, 5, and 15 months after surgery) revealed that the patient had been free from episodes of collapse since surgery. No regrowth of the mass was noted on follow-up echocardiograms, and the pulmonic stenosis had resolved, although mild to moderate pulmonary insufficiency later developed. The bladder mass was excised 15 months after the first surgery when hematuria developed, and results of histologic examination of this mass revealed a vascular hamartoma. The dog was eventually euthanized 31 months after the initial surgery for reasons that could not be directly linked to any recurrence of the pulmonary artery mass.
   Clinical Relevance-Hamartomas are benign tumors that can be located in various tissues, including large arteries. Computed tomography was helpful in predicting the resectability of the intracardiac mass in this dog. Treatment with arteriotomy under inflow occlusion and mild hypothermia resulted in a favorable outcome. (J Am Vet Med Assoc 2012;240:858-862)

AB A 40 yr-old female white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) suffered from chronic nail-bed abscesses. Due to worsening of clinical signs, the animal's nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatment was switched to firocoxib. Approximately 7 days after this change, the animal developed multifocal vesicles and bullae along the lateral aspects of the thorax and abdomen, the dorsum, and the proximal limbs. Cytology and culture did not identify an infectious etiology. Histologically, the lesions consisted of a severe, subacute vesiculobullous dermatitis with intraepidermal to subepidermal clefting with areas of individual keratinocyte necrosis and minor neutrophilic epidermal infiltrates. These findings are similar to those seen in some drug reactions in people; therefore an adverse drug reaction to the firocoxib was suspected.

AB In humans, congenital and hereditary skin diseases associated with epidermal cell-cell separation (acantholysis) are very rare, and spontaneous animal models of these diseases are exceptional. Our objectives are to report a novel congenital acantholytic dermatosis that developed in Chesapeake Bay retriever dogs. Nine affected puppies in four different litters were born to eight closely related clinically normal dogs. The disease transmission was consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Clinical signs occurred immediately after birth with superficial epidermal layers sloughing upon pressure. At three month of age, dogs exhibited recurrent superficial skin sloughing and erosions at areas of friction and mucocutaneous junctions; their coat was also finer than normal and there were patches of partial hair loss. At birth, histopathology revealed severe suprabasal acantholysis, which became less severe with ageing. Electron microscopy demonstrated a reduced number of partially formed desmosomes with detached and aggregated keratin intermediate filaments. Immunostaining for desmosomal adhesion molecules revealed a complete lack of staining for plakophilin-1 and anomalies in the distribution of desmoplakin and keratins 10 and 14. Sequencing revealed a homozygous splice donor site mutation within the first intron of PKP1 resulting in a premature stop codon, thereby explaining the inability to detect plakophilin-1 in the skin. Altogether, the clinical and pathological findings, along with the PKP1 mutation, were consistent with the diagnosis of ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome with plakophilin-1 deficiency. This is the first occurrence of ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome in an animal species. Controlled mating of carrier dogs would yield puppies that could, in theory, be tested for gene therapy of this rare but severe skin disease of children.

SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY

DT Article
ID AUTOIMMUNE SKIN-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; DOGS; PERSPECTIVE; RETINOPATHY
AB Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a common canine autoimmune disease that usually manifests as a localized ulcerative and scarring nasal dermatitis. We report herein a generalized variant of canine DLE successfully treated with the antimalarial immunomodulator hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). A 9-year-old hairless Chinese crested dog was presented with annular and polycyclic hyperpigmented and scaly skin lesions with central erosions, hypopigmentation and/or scarring on the trunk, neck and lateral extremities. Associated systemic signs were not seen. The clinical diagnosis of generalized DLE was supported by the demonstration of lymphocyte-rich interface dermatitis with epidermal atrophy and dermo-epidermal deposition of immunoglobulins and activated complement. As for human DLE, treatment was initiated with HCQ at 5 mg/kg once daily along with 2 weeks of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment and restriction of sun exposure. Over the following year, complete remission was maintained with HCQ at 5 mg/kg orally once daily with the exception of three relapses; two occurred during treatment induction and the third arose when the frequency of HCQ administration was reduced to every other day. Disease flares were controlled with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment alternating with 0.1% prednicarbate cream once daily for 510 days. Altogether, adverse drug events were not seen with this regimen. In summary, clinically, histologically and immunologically, this dogs disease mirrored the generalized discoid variant of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus of humans. The apparent benefit of HCQ, its safety and low cost warrant future investigations of its use for treatment of canine cutaneous lupus variants.

   RADIOTHERAPY; CANCER; RADIATION; THERAPY
AB Purpose: It is unknown whether a thermal dose should be administered using a few large fractions with higher temperatures or a larger number of fractions with lower temperatures. To evaluate this we assessed the effect of administering the same total thermal dose, approximately 30 CEM43T(90), in one versus three to four fractions per week, over 5 weeks.
   Materials and methods: Canine sarcomas were randomised to receive one of the hyperthermia fractionation schemes along with fractionated radiotherapy. Tumour response was based on changes in tumour volume, oxygenation, water diffusion quantified using MRI, and a panel of histological and immunohistochemical end points.
   Results: There was a greater reduction in tumour volume and water diffusion at the end of therapy in tumours receiving one hyperthermia fraction per week. There was a weak but significant association between improved tumour oxygenation 24 h after the first hyperthermia treatment and extent of volume reduction at the end of therapy. Finally, the direction of change of HIF-1 alpha and CA-IX immunoreactivity after the first hyperthermia fraction was similar and there was an inverse relationship between temperature and the direction of change of CA-IX. There were no significant changes in interstitial fluid pressure, VEGF, vWF, apoptosis or necrosis as a function of treatment group or temperature.
   Conclusions: We did not identify an advantage to a three to four per week hyperthermia prescription, and response data pointed to a one per week prescription being superior.

AB Hydroxylated fullerenes (C60OHx) or fullerols are water-soluble carbon nanoparticles that have been explored for potential therapeutic applications. This study assesses acute in vivo tolerance in 8-wk-old female Sprague-Dawley rats to intravenous (iv) administration of 10 mg/kg of well-characterized C-60(OH)(30). Complete histopathology and clinical chemistries are assessed at 8, 24, and 48 h after dosing. Minor histopathology changes are seen, primarily in one animal. No clinically significant chemistry changes were observed after treatment. These experiments suggest that this fullerol was well tolerated after iv administration to rats.

AB Background: Among diseases that cause splenomegaly in dogs, lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH), splenic hemangiosarcoma (HSA), and fibrohistiocytic nodules (FHN) are common diagnoses. The spleen plays an important role in the immunologic control or elimination of vector-transmitted, blood-borne pathogens, including Bartonella sp., Babesia sp., and hemotropic Mycoplasma sp.
   Objective: To compare the prevalence of Bartonella sp., Babesia sp., and hemotropic Mycoplasma sp. DNA in spleens from dogs with LNH, HSA, and FHN. Materials and Methods: Paraffin-embedded, surgically obtained biopsy tissues from LNH (N = 50), HSA (N = 50), and FHN (N = 37) were collected from the anatomic pathology archives. Spleens from specific pathogen-free (SPF) dogs (N = 8) were used as controls. Bartonella sp., Babesia sp., and Mycoplasma sp. DNA was amplified by PCR, followed by DNA sequencing.
   Results: Bartonella sp. DNA was more prevalent in FHN (29.7%) and HSA (26%) as compared to LNH (10%) (P = .019, .0373, respectively) or control spleens (0.0%). The prevalence of Babesia sp. and hemotropic Mycoplasma sp. DNA was significantly lower than Bartonella sp. DNA in HSA (P = .0005, .006, respectively) and FHN (P = .003, .0004, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in DNA prevalence among the 3 genera in the LNH group.
   Conclusions: The higher prevalence of Bartonella sp. in FHN and HSA warrants future investigations to determine if this bacterium plays a role in the development of these splenic diseases.

AB Promeris Duo (PD) is a novel topical flea and tick preventative for dogs, which is also licensed for treatment of canine demodicosis. In this article, we present 22 dogs that all developed pemphigus foliaceus (PF)-like cutaneous drug reactions at the site of PD application. In eight dogs, the lesions were restricted to the application site (localized group). Signs of systemic illness were reported in three dogs, and four required immunosuppressive treatment. Direct immunofluorescence for IgG was positive in four dogs, although circulating antikeratinocyte IgG could not be detected in any tested sera. Complete remission was achieved in all dogs, with one patient still remaining on treatment. Fourteen dogs developed skin lesions at the application site as well as other noncontiguous areas (distant group). Systemic signs were reported in 11 dogs, and immunosuppression was required in 10 cases. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence tests were positive for antikeratinocyte autoantibodies in 10 of 13 and six of 10 patients with distant disease, respectively. Complete remission was achieved in 10 of 13 dogs with distant disease; one-third are still on treatment. Histological changes were similar to canine PF. Desmosomal architectural changes, assessed by desmoglein-1 immunostaining, were also similar to those of dogs with spontaneous autoimmune PF. Apoptosis did not appear to contribute to lesion formation, in either autoimmune or PD-associated PF. In conclusion, PD has the potential of triggering a variant of PF that resembles spontaneously occurring autoimmune PF at clinical, morphological, immunological and treatment outcome levels.

AB Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is the most common canine autoimmune skin disease. In contrast to human PF (hPF), desmoglein-1 is a minor autoantigen in the canine disease. The major autoantigen(s) of canine PF (cPF) remain(s) unknown, which limits the ability to perform mechanistic studies of lesion formation and the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this disease. The immunofluorescence patterns of selected desmosomal (desmoglein-1, desmoglein-3, desmocollin-1, desmocollin-3, desmoplakin-1/2, plakoglobin and plakophilin-1) and nondesmosomal adhesion proteins (E-cadherin, claudin-1, zona occludens-1 and occludin) in healthy canine footpad, haired skin and buccal mucosal epithelia were determined using hPF and pemphigus vulgaris sera and specific antibodies. The immunostaining patterns were then compared with that of indirect immunofluorescence staining with 66 cPF sera. Most cPF sera (58 of 66; 88%) exhibited positive staining along keratinocyte margins in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum of canine footpad. One serum contained autoantibodies binding solely to stratum granulosum keratinocytes. Concurrent intercellular fluorescence in the stratum basale was limited to seven of 66 cPF sera (11%). Only 12 of 66 cPF sera (18%) also exhibited positive IF staining of the buccal mucosa. This study confirms the immunological heterogeneity of cPF immunoglobulin G autoantibodies. Moreover, the major indirect immunofluorescence staining pattern and the inability of most cPF sera to label the buccal mucosa closely matched that of desmocollin-1. These observations warrant further investigation of desmocollin-1 as a potential major cPF autoantigen.

AB Stringently controlled in vitro experiments are a necessary part of translational research. Cell lines are useful for exploring the underlying biology of cancer. Very few canine soft tissue sarcoma cell lines exist. This report describes the establishment of a new canine soft tissue sarcoma cell line (MBSa1) derived from a high-grade, metastatic neurofibrosarcoma. The primary tumor tissue was obtained from a 12-year-old neutered male German Shepherd Dog and was maintained in tissue culture for a minimum of 20 passages over 7 months. MBSa1 was injected into athymic mice to determine tumorigenicity. Five million cells were injected into the subcutis of the right flank of athymic nude mice. Nine of the 10 mice grew tumors 1 cm or larger within 8 weeks of cell injection. The large number of in vitro passages coupled with solid tumor formation in athymic nude mice demonstrates that MBSa1 has been immortalized and is tumorigenic.

AB An adult alpaca was presented because of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with an intestinal obstruction. The putative diagnosis at surgery was an intestinal obstruction caused by peritonitis and intra-abdominal adhesions. The cause of the inflammation was not determined at that time. The alpaca died soon after surgery from post-surgical complications and a peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia that was not diagnosed until necropsy.

AB Sp proteins are evolutionarily conserved transcription factors required for the expression of a wide variety of genes that are critical for development and cell cycle progression. Deregulated expression of certain Sp proteins is associated with the formation of a variety of human tumors; however, direct evidence that any given Sp protein is oncogenic has been lacking. Here, we report that Sp2 protein abundance in mice increases in concert with the progression of carcinogen-induced murine squamous cell carcinomas. Transgenic mice specifically overexpressing murine Sp2 in epidermal basal keratinocytes were highly susceptible to wound-and carcinogen-induced papillomagenesis. Transgenic animals that were homozygous rather than hemizygous for the Sp2 transgene exhibited a striking arrest in the epidermal differentiation program, perishing within 2 weeks of birth. Our results directly support the likelihood that Sp2 overexpression occurring in various human cancers has significant functional effect. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8507-16. (C)2010 AACR.

AB This study was undertaken to characterize the effects of constitutive expression of the hedgehog transcriptional activator, Gli2, in porcine skin. The keratinocyte-specific human transgene, K5-hGli2 Delta N, was used to produce transgenic porcine lines via somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques. In mice, K5-hGli2 Delta N induces epithelial downgrowths resembling basal cell carcinomas. Our porcine model also developed these basal cell carcinoma-like lesions, however gross tumor development was not appreciated. In contrast to the murine model, diffuse epidermal changes as well as susceptibility to cutaneous infections were seen in the swine model. Histologic analysis of transgenic piglets revealed generalized epidermal changes including: epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis), elongated rete ridges, parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, epidermal neutrophilic infiltration, capillary loop dilation and hypogranulosis. By 2 weeks of age, the transgenic piglets developed erythematic and edematous lesions at high contact epidermal areas and extensor surfaces of distal limb joints. Despite antibiotic treatment, these lesions progressed to a deep bacterial pyoderma and pigs died or were euthanized within weeks of birth. Non-transgenic littermates were phenotypically normal by gross and histological analysis. In summary, constitutive expression of the human hGli2 Delta N in keratinocytes, results in cutaneous changes that have not been reported in the K5-hGli2 Delta N murine model. These findings indicate a need for a multiple species animal model approach in order to better understand the role of Gli2 in mammalian skin.

   SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG; 2 DOGS; HYPOAMINOACIDEMIA; INSULINOMA
AB Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME; also known as superficial necrolytic dermatitis) is a syndrome most often associated with certain chronic liver diseases or pancreatic glucagonomas. In humans with glucaconoma-associated NME, skin lesions usually respond to octreotide, a somatostatin analogue that inhibits glucagon release. In this report an 11-year-old golden retriever dog with pancreatic glucononoma and metastasis to the regional lymph nodes, spleen and liver was diagnosed with NME. The dog exhibited erosions, ulcers and crusts on the paws, pressure points, muzzle, periocular area and prepuce. The dog was also anorexic and had difficulty walking. Because metastasis precluded surgery, treatment was initiated with subcutaneous octreotide (2 mu g/kg twice daily). Skin lesions and systemic clinical signs improved markedly within 5 days. The dosage was increased to nearly 3 mu g/kg twice daily and signs almost completely resolved within 10 days. Anorexia was the major adverse effect observed. During the following month, both dosage (1-3.7 mu g/kg) and frequency (two to four times daily) of the octreotide injections were adjusted to permit control of clinical signs while maintaining adequate appetite. Temporary cessation of octreotide administration resulted in the rapid recurrence of skin lesions. Resuming injections led to improvement of clinical signs within 48 h. The dog was later euthanized because of progressive metastatic disease. In conclusion, subcutaneous octreotide injections were beneficial in this dog with glucagonoma-associated NME. This somatostatin analogue could be a valuable option to treat canine patients with non-resectable or relapsing pancreatic glucagonoma-associated NME.

AB The purpose of this study is to characterize the sonographic appearance of canine parathyroid glands using high-resolution ultrasonography. Ten cadaver dogs were studied after euthanasia for reasons not relating to the parathyroid. The cervical region was examined using a 13-5MHz linear transducer in right and left recumbency. Ultrasonographic features of the parathyroid and thyroid glands were compared with the gross and histopathologic findings. Thirty-five structures were identified sonographically as parathyroid glands but only 26 of 35 glands (74% positive predictive value) were proven to be normal parathyroid glands histopathologically. Of the nine false positives, five (14%) were proven to be lobular thyroid tissue. The remaining four (11%) structures were visible grossly or found histopathologically. There were no statistical differences between ultrasonographic and gross measurements of the parathyroid glands. The average size as seen sonographically was 3.3 X 2.2 X 1.7 mm and the average gross size was 3.7 X 2.6 X 1.6 mm (length, width, height). The average size of the thyroid lobules assessed sonographically was 2.3 X 1.6 X 0.8 mm (length, width, height). Normal parathyroid glands can be identified using high-resolution ultrasonography. But some thyroid lobules will be misinterpreted as parathyroid glands; this will result in false positives when identifying parathyroid glands with ultrasonography.

AB Background
   Hereditary cerebellar degeneration is described in several dog breeds. This heterogeneous group of diseases causes cerebellar ataxia associated with cerebellar cortical degeneration.
   Objective
   To report the clinical and histopathological features, and describe the mode of inheritance of hereditary cerebellar degeneration in Scottish Terriers.
   Animals
   Sixty-two affected dogs recruited through the Scottish Terrier Club of America.
   Materials and Methods
   Prospective, observational study: Owners of affected dogs were contacted for a description of clinical signs, age of onset, and disease progression. Medical records, videotapes of gait, and brain imaging were evaluated. When possible, necropsy was performed and the brain examined histopathologically. Prevalence of the disease was estimated and a pedigree analysis was performed to determine mode of inheritance.
   Results
   Gait abnormalities were noted in the 1st year of life in 76% of dogs, and progressed slowly; only 1 of 27 dogs dead at time of writing was euthanized because of cerebellar degeneration. Clinical signs included wide based stance, dysmetria, intention tremor, and difficulty negotiating stairs and running. Cerebellar atrophy was detected on magnetic resonance imaging. On histopathological examination, there was segmental loss of Purkinje neurons, thinning of molecular and granular layers, and polyglucosan bodies in the molecular layer. Prevalence of disease was estimated at 1 in 1,335 American Kennel Club registered Scottish Terriers. Genetic analysis results are consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.
   Conclusion and Clinical Importance
   A hereditary cerebellar degenerative disorder with a relatively mild phenotype has emerged in the Scottish Terrier. Genetic studies are needed.

AB C/EBP alpha and C/EBP beta are bZIP transcription factors that are highly expressed in the interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous glands of skin and yet germ line deletion of either family member alone has only mild or no effect on keratinocyte biology and their role in sebocyte biology has never been examined. To address possible functional redundancies and reveal functional roles of C/EBP alpha and C/EBP beta in postnatal skin, mouse models were developed in which either family member could be acutely ablated alone or together in the epidermis and sebaceous glands of adult mice. Acute removal of either C/EBP alpha or C/EBP beta alone in adult mouse skin revealed modest to no discernable changes in epidermis or sebaceous glands. In contrast, co-ablation of C/EBP alpha and C/EBP beta in postnatal epidermis resulted in disruption of stratified squamous differentiation characterized by hyperproliferation of basal and suprabasal keratinocytes and a defective basal to spinous keratinocyte transition involving an expanded basal compartment and a diminished and delayed spinous compartment. Acute co-ablation of C/EBP alpha and C/EBP beta in sebaceous glands resulted in severe morphological defects, and sebocyte differentiation was blocked as determined by lack of sebum production and reduced expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD3) and melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), two markers of terminal sebocyte differentiation. Specialized sebocytes of Meibomian glands and preputial glands were also affected. Our results indicate that in adult mouse skin, C/EBP alpha and C/EBP beta are critically involved in regulating sebocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis involving the basal to spinous keratinocyte transition and basal cell cycle withdrawal.

AB The inhibitory effect of 0.0584% hydrocortisone aceponate spray on immediate- and late-phase skin reactions and the duration of inhibition after medication withdrawal were studied in 10 Maltese-beagle atopic dogs. All subjects were sprayed on axillary and inguinal regions and on one randomly chosen side of the thorax once daily for 14 (phase 1) or 7 days (phase 2). Intradermal injections (IDT) of histamine and anticanine IgE antiserum were performed bilaterally on the thorax before, 7 and 14 days after treatment. During phase 2, IDT was performed once weekly for 5 weeks. Each IDT was evaluated by an investigator blinded to the site of active treatment. Skin biopsies of 24-h anti-IgE-associated late-phase reactions were collected from both thoracic sides before and 14 days after treatment to determine the number of inflammatory cells and dermal thickness. Phase 1: Histamine and anti-IgE-induced global wheal scores at treated sites were significantly lower after 7 and 14 days with negative reactions present in > 90% of dogs. Late-phase reactions at both sides were also significantly decreased compared with that at baseline, and this was associated with reduced inflammatory cell influx. Moreover, a significant decrease in dermal thickness was recorded at treated sides after 14 days. Phase 2: Histamine reactions became positive at untreated sides in all dogs 2 weeks after treatment. In conclusion, the 0.0584% hydrocortisone aceponate spray significantly decreased immediate- and late-phase IDT reactions, and prolonged application caused skin atrophy at treated sites. A 2-week withdrawal period prior to IDT is proposed.

   BULLOUS IMPETIGO; DESMOGLEIN-1; DOGS; DERMATOPHYTOSIS
AB Failure of desmosomal adhesion with ensuing keratinocyte separation - a phenomenon called acantholysis - can result from genetic, autoimmune or infectious proteolytic causes. Rare hereditary disorders of desmosomal formation have been identified in animals. Familial acantholysis of Angus calves and hereditary suprabasal acantholytic mechanobullous dermatosis of buffaloes appear to be similar to acantholytic epidermolysis bullosa of human beings. A genetic acantholytic dermatosis resembling human Darier disease has been rarely recognized in dogs. In autoimmune blistering dermatoses, circulating auto-antibodies bind to the extracellular segments of desmosomal proteins and induce acantholysis. Autoantibodies against desmoglein-3 are found in canine pemphigus vulgaris and paraneoplastic pemphigus. Autoantibodies against desmoglein-1 have been rarely detected in dogs with pemphigus foliaceus. When circulating autoantibodies target desmogleins-1 and -3, mucocutaneous pemphigus vulgaris develops in dogs. Finally, several infectious agents can release proteases that cleave desmosomal bonds. In superficial pustular dermatophytosis of dogs and horses, Trichophyton hyphae colonize the stratum corneum, and acantholysis presumably develops because of proteases secreted by the dermatophytes. In exudative epidermitis of piglets, Staphylococcus bacteria - usually Staphylococcus hyicus - release exfoliatin toxins that bind to and specifically cleave desmoglein-1. Any of the above mechanisms can result in impairment of desmosomal function with subsequent acantholysis. The end point of adhesion failure is identical among these diseases: there is cleft formation where desmosomes are affected. The similarity of mechanisms explains why clinical and microscopic skin lesions overlap between entities, thus leaving clinicians and dermatopathologists with the conundrum of determining whether the acantholysis is of genetic, autoimmune or infectious origin.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Numerous attributes render the domestic dog a highly pertinent model for cancer-associated gene discovery. We performed microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 60 spontaneous canine intracranial tumors to examine the degree to which dog and human patients exhibit aberrations of ancestrally related chromosome regions, consistent with a shared pathogenesis. Canine gliomas and meningiomas both demonstrated chromosome copy number aberrations (CNAs) that share evolutionarily conserved synteny with those previously reported in their human counterpart. Interestingly, however, genomic imbalances orthologous to some of the hallmark aberrations of human intracranial tumors, including chromosome 22/NF2 deletions in meningiomas and chromosome 1p/19q deletions in oligodendrogliomas, were not major events in the dog. Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, we identified highly recurrent CNAs in canine intracranial tumors for which the human orthologue has been reported previously at low frequency but which have not, thus far, been associated intimately with the pathogenesis of the tumor. The presence of orthologous CNAs in canine and human intracranial cancers is strongly suggestive of their biological significance in tumor development and/or progression. Moreover, the limited genetic heterogenity within purebred dog populations, coupled with the contrasting organization of the dog and human karyotypes, offers tremendous opportunities for refining evolutionarily conserved regions of tumor-associated genomic imbalance that may harbor novel candidate genes involved in their pathogenesis. A comparative approach to the study of canine and human intracranial tumors may therefore provide new insights into their genetic etiology, towards development of more sophisticated molecular subclassification and tailored therapies in both species.

AB The genus Bartonella comprises a group of gram-negative, fastidious bacteria. Because of diagnostic limitations of culture and serologic testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a powerful tool for the detection of Bartonella spp. in blood and tissue samples. However, because many wild and domestic animals harbor Bartonella spp., transfer of Bartonella DNA during sample collection or histologic processing could result in false-positive PCR test results. In this study, we describe evidence of Bartonella DNA dissemination and transfer in the necropsy room and during the subsequent processing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Bartonella DNA was amplified from different areas of the necropsy room, from the liquid paraffin in the tissue processor, and from different parts of the microtome. Unless stringent procedures are established and followed to avoid cross-contamination, the molecular detection of Bartonella spp. from tissue samples obtained at necropsy or processed in a multispecies histopathology laboratory will not be reliable.

Histologically, the neoplasm was composed Of Sheets of round cells with distinct plasmacytoid features and marked anisocytosis and anisokaryosis. Cells were positive for vimentin, CD18, CD79a, and lambda light-chain, and negative for kappa light chain, cytokeratin, lysozyme, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and S100 protein. Clonally rearranged B-cell antigen receptor genes were detected by PARR (polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangements), confirming clonal proliferation of B lymphocytes. Although primary solitary intracerebral plasmacytoma is rare in dogs and other species, it should be included in the differential diagnosis for central nervous system round-cell neoplasms. Clonality testing can be utilized to Support the histological diagnosis of this neoplasm type.

AB The broad spectrum of clinical signs in canine cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma mimics many inflammatory skin diseases and is a diagnostic challenge. A 13-year-old-male castrated golden retriever crossbred dog presented with multifocal flaccid bullae evolving into deep erosions. A shearing force applied to the skin at the periphery of the erosions caused the epidermis to further slide off the dermis suggesting intraepidermal or subepidermal separation. Systemic signs consisted of profound weight loss and marked respiratory distress. Histologically, the superficial and deep dermis were infiltrated by large, CD3-positive neoplastic lymphocytes and mild epitheliotropism involved the deep epidermis, hair follicle walls and epitrichial sweat glands. There was partial loss of the stratum basale. Bullous lesions consisted of large dermoepidermal and intraepidermal clefts that contained loose accumulations of neutrophils mixed with fewer neoplastic cells in proteinaceous fluid. The lifted epidermis was often devitalized and bordered by hydropic degeneration and partial epidermal collapse. Similar neoplastic lymphocytes formed small masses in the lungs associated with broncho-invasion. Clonal rearrangement analysis of antigen receptor genes in samples from skin and lung lesions using primers specific for canine T-cell receptor gamma (TCR gamma) produced a single-sized amplicon of identical sequence, indicating that both lesions resulted from the expansion of the same neoplastic T-cell population. Macroscopic vesiculobullous lesions with devitalization of the lesional epidermis should be included in the broad spectrum of clinical signs presented by canine cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma.

TI Post-traumatic peripheral arteriovenous fistula manifesting as digital

SO VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY

AB Arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) are defined as congenital or acquired abnormal direct communications between an artery and a vein leading to abnormal blood circulation. This report describes an unusual manifestation of acquired peripheral AVF in a cat for which the diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomographic (CT) imaging and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. A 10-year-old female spayed domestic shorthaired cat was presented with a 2-month history of nonhealing, crusting, erosive and ulcerative skin lesions on the dorsal right forepaw. Severe chewing and biting, but not lameness, had been reported. Systemic abnormalities were not noted. Histopathology revealed increased numbers of thin-walled and slightly grouped vascular profiles in the superficial and mid-dermis, which were often markedly dilated and partially obscured by prominent hyaline deposits. There were a few pyknotic nuclear fragments and haemorrhages in vascular walls as well as multifocal luminal thrombosis with or without recanalization. Differential diagnoses included progressive angiomatosis with trauma or AVF with secondary regional venous hypertension. Computed tomographic images were acquired using a 16-slice Siemens Somotom Sensation CT scanner, and 3D images were created using the Voxar 3D software. Image reconstruction revealed tortuous aberrant vasculature on the medial aspect of the radius and around the carpus compared to normal vascularization on the contralateral limb. These changes were suggestive of the diagnosis of acquired peripheral AVF. The differential diagnosis for localized, nonhealing, haemorrhagic, crusted, erosive or ulcerative distal extremity skin lesions in cats should include acquired AVF, and diagnosis may be confirmed with contrast-enhanced CT imaging.

AB Objective-To evaluate the stability and retention of viscous formulations of the antifungal drug clotrimazole in vitro and to evaluate retention times, absorption, and histologic response to these compounds when placed in the frontal sinus of dogs.
   Animals-6 male Beagles.
   Procedures-1% clotrimazole gels were formulated with hydroxypropyl cellulose, poloxamer, and carboxymethylcellulose sodium bases. Commercially available 1% clotrimazole creams were also evaluated. Each compound was incubated at 37 degrees C in a funnel. Volume retained and clotrimazole stability were evaluated for 4 weeks. Six compounds were then chosen for in vivo evaluation. The frontal sinuses of 6 dogs were filled with 1 of the 6 compounds. Computed tomographic evaluation was performed weekly for up to 4 weeks to evaluate gel retention. Blood samples were collected to evaluate clotrimazole absorption. Following euthanasia, sinuses were examined histologically.
   Results-Commercially available clotrimazole creams were not retained in funnels in vitro. In vivo, hydroxypropyl cellulose- and carboxymethylcellulose-based gels resulted in the most severe inflammatory response and were retained the longest. Poloxamer-based gels had a shorter retention time and were associated with less inflammation. Clotrimazole was minimally absorbed. Despite a marked inflammatory response to several of the clotrimazole-containing gels, no notable adverse clinical responses were observed.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Poloxamer gels had the most promise for improving drug contact within the frontal sinus of dogs, while limiting the inflammatory response. Poloxamer gels have the additional benefit of improved handling as a result of reverse gelation (ie, they gel when warmed to 37 degrees C).(Am J Vet Res 2009:70:640-647)

AB Objective-To evaluate the effects of fascial abrasion, fasciotomy, and fascial excision on cutaneous wound healing in cats.
   Animals-Eight 1- to 3-year-old domestic shorthair cats.
   Procedures-8 evenly spaced 4-cm(2) skin wounds were created on each cat's dorsum, and the underlying subcutaneous tissue was removed to expose the epaxial muscle fascia. Wounds were randomized to receive 1 of 4 treatments (2 wounds/treatment/cat): fascial abrasion, fasciotomy, fascial excision, or control treatment (muscle fascia not disturbed). Bandages were changed and digital photographs and acetate tracings of the wounds were obtained for planimetry daily for 1 week, every other day for 2 weeks, and then every third day for 3 weeks (ie, 40-day observation period). Digitized images were evaluated for granulation tissue formation, wound contraction (surface area measurements), and area of epithelialization.
   Results-The epithelialized area and open and total wound areas did not differ among treatments at any time point. Time to the first appearance of granulation tissue was significantly shorter for all treatment groups, compared with that of the control group. Time to achieve granulation tissue coverage of wound base was significantly shorter following fasciotomy (9.6 days) and fascial excision (9.0 days), compared with that of control treatment (18.5 days) or abrasion (16.7 days). Numbers of wounds that developed exuberant granulation tissue following fascial excision (9/16) and control treatment (3/16) differed significantly.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Fasciotomy and fascial excision facilitated early granulation tissue development in cutaneous wounds in cats. In clinical use, these fascial treatments may expedite secondary wound closure or skin grafting. (Am J Vet Res 2009;70:532-538)

AB A captive adult male grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) was evaluated due to multifocal wounds of the skin and subcutaneous tissues sustained its a result of trauma front another grizzly bear. On presentation, one lesion that was located in the perineal region seemed to be it deep puncture with purple tissue protruding from it. This perineal wound did not heal in the same manner or rate as did the other Wounds. Twenty-five days after initial detection. substantial active hemorrhage from the lesion occurred and necessitated anesthesia for examination of the bear. The entire lesion was Surgically excised, which later proved curative. An acquired arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed via histopathology. Arteriovenous fistulas can develop after traumatic injury and should be considered as a potential complication in bears with nonhealing Wounds.

AB This case series describes multiple mortalities associated with sepsis, neoplasia. and endoparasitism in yellow-tipped sea kraits (Laticauda colubrina) at an exhibit aquarium. Over a 2-yr period, the facility kept 42 L. colubrina, of which 38 died and 19 were suitable for necropsy and histopathology. The common clinical syndrome seen in these animals consisted of partial to compete anorexia, increased time spent "hauled-out" on land, intermittent regurgitation, chronic lethargy, and weight loss. Few animals died without premonitory signs. Nutritional support and treatment for presumptive parasitism and sepsis were unsuccessful. The mortality seen in this collection of sea kraits could be placed into three groups: one group of animals (n = 9) died of sepsis secondary to necrotizing enteritis or pneumonia: one group (n = 6) remained apparently healthy for over 1 yr and then died with multifocal granulomas and sepsis; and the last group (n = 3) died as a result of multicentric lymphoid neoplasia with secondary sepsis. The unifying factor in the majority of these cases is the presence of septicemia as the proximate cause of death. Based on the clinical picture. it is presumed that an immunosuppressive event, such as transport, captivity stress, or possible concurrent viral infection, resulted in a septic event and death.

AB To determine the clinical course in dogs with aural cholesteatoma.
   Case series.
   Dogs (n=20) with aural cholesteatoma.
   Case review (1998-2007).
   Twenty dogs were identified. Clinical signs other than those of chronic otitis externa included head tilt (6 dogs), unilateral facial palsy (4), pain on opening or inability to open the mouth (4), and ataxia (3). Computed tomography (CT) was performed in 19 dogs, abnormalities included osteoproliferation (13 dogs), lysis of the bulla (12), expansion of the bulla (11), bone lysis in the squamous or petrosal portion of the temporal bone (4) and enlargement of associated lymph nodes (7). Nineteen dogs had total ear canal ablation-lateral bulla osteotomy or ventral bulla osteotomy with the intent to cure; 9 dogs had no further signs of middle ear disease whereas 10 had persistent or recurrent clinical signs. Risk factors for recurrence after surgery were inability to open the mouth or neurologic signs on admission and lysis of any portion of the temporal bone on CT imaging. Dogs admitted with neurologic signs or inability to open the mouth had a median survival of 16 months.
   Early surgical treatment of aural cholesteatoma may be curative. Recurrence after surgery is associated with advanced disease, typically indicated by inability to open the jaw, neurologic disease, or bone lysis on CT imaging.
   Presence of aural cholesteatoma may affect the prognosis for successful surgical treatment of middle ear disease.

ID AA-AMYLOIDOSIS; DIAGNOSIS
AB A 16-yr-old, captive-born, female California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) was evaluated for intermittent lethargy, partial anorexia, and polydipsia of 2 wk duration. The animal was immobilized for physical examination. It was in thin body condition, with multifocal mucosal ulcerations over the caudal and ventral tongue. Blood was collected for hematology, serum chemistry, and leptospirosis serology. Serum chemistry revealed severe azotemia, mild hyperglycemia, and severe hyperphosphatemia. The animal went into cardiac arrest during recovery from anesthesia and died. On histopathology, abundant amorphous, finely fibrillar, eosinophilic material was deposited in the kidneys, and smaller amounts of the same material were found in the splenic and pancreatic vessels; these findings are consistent with systemic secondary amyloidosis. The animal also had chronic nephritis, which, coupled with renal amyloidosis, resulted in renal failure and death. Systemic amyloidosis should be considered as an additional differential diagnosis for renal failure in California sea lions.

AB A primary intimal aortic angiosarcoma was diagnosed in a 4-year-old, spayed female German Shepherd that presented for complications of thromboembolic disease because of infarcts in multiple organs. On gross examination, aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta was associated with a friable, necrotic mass attached to the endothelial surface, which partially occluded the aortic lumen. On histologic examination, plump neoplastic spindle cells formed a plaque-like mass arising from the intima that merged with a large accumulation of fibrin and necrotic debris, and projected into the lumen. Neoplastic cells invaded periaortic vessels and were seen in some infarct-associated thromboemboli. Tumor cells expressed vimentin and CD31, with infrequent, patchy staining with factor VIII-related antigen; tumor cells were negative for cytokeratin and smooth-muscle actin. Aortic angiosarcoma is a rare malignancy in humans. This is the first description of a primary intimal aortic angiosarcoma in a dog, with immunohistochemical evidence of endothelial origin.

AB An adult female golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) developed a firm subcutaneous mass on the lateral distal right forelimb that progressed to diffuse limb enlargement accompanied by extensive cutaneous ulceration and drainage and axillary lymph node metastasis. Touch imprint cytology revealed pleomorphic neoplastic mesenchymal cells. On histology, the invasive neoplasm merged with a large subcutaneous nerve and was composed of spindle cells with a high mitotic index, and lymph node metastasis was confirmed. Histologic morphology and positive immunohistochemical staining of neoplastic cells for vimentin, S100, and neuron-specific enolase were consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Although relatively common in dogs, peripheral nerve sheath tumors had not been reported previously in hamsters.

AB Intramedullary cavernous malformations (CVMs) of the spinal cord were diagnosed in 2 adult dogs that presented for paraparesis. An intramedullary spinal cord lesion was identified on a myelogram in the first dog, and expansion of the vertebral canal was evident on radiographs in the second. Extensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage was found on gross postmortem examination in both dogs, and a distinct lobulated intramedullary mass was evident in the second dog. Microscopically, both lesions were composed of dilated, thin-walled vascular channels with little-to-no intervening neural parenchyma. Both dogs had evidence of channel thrombosis along with perilesional hemorrhage and hemosiderin accumulation. The second dog had additional degenerative changes, including thickened fibrous channel walls with hyalinization, foci of mineralization, and occasional tongues of entrapped gliotic neuropil. CVMs appear to be an uncommon cause of both acute and chronic spinal cord disease in the dog.

AB An adult female, albino South African Clawed frog (Xeuopus laevis) from a research colony at the Biological Resources Facility of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at North Carolina State University (NCSU) was presented with depression, lethargy, loss of diving reflex, and a distended abdomen. Cytologic examination of coelomic effusion fluid at the NCSU veterinary teaching hospital revealed a mixed population of inflammatory cells, including heterophils and a predominance of large mononuclear cells (macrophages) that often contained intracytoplasmic, negatively-stained, rod-shaped to filamentous organisms consistent with Mycobacterium sp. Ziehl-Neelsen stain revealed bright pink to red, acid-fast organisms with a beaded appearance. Histopathologic findings in tissues obtained at necropsy included marked, multifocal to coalescing, heterophilic, granulomatous and fibrinous coelomitis as well as severe multifocal heterophilic and granulomatous hepatitis, interstitial pneumonia and sinusitis/rhinitis. Slender gram-positive, acid-fast bacterial rods were identified in sections of coelomic pleura, kidneys, nasal cavities, spleen, liver, and pulmonary interstitium, indicative of systemic mycobacteriosis. Based on mycobacterial culture, the organism was identified as M marinum complex. Mycobacteria are variably gram-positive, often acid-fast, small rods that are ubiquitous in aquatic environments. The clinical and pathologic spectrum of disease in amphibians depends on host and pathogen status. Xenopus sp and several other frogs are good models for studying the pathogenesis of M tuberculosis infection. In addition to culture, polymerase chain reaction assays may be used for definitive identification of the organisms; accurate speciation may require further genetic investigation.

   ETIOLOGY
AB Uterine leiomyomas, commonly termed fibroids, clinically affect approximately 25% of women of reproductive age in the United States, with a subclinical incidence as high as 77%. The pathogenesis of fibroid formation remains poorly understood, due in large part to the lack of a suitable animal model. This retrospective study characterizes the clinical, gross, and histopathologic features of similar, spontaneously occurring uterine tumors in potbellied pigs. Medical records available through a local Potbellied Pig Spay/Neuter Program, pig sanctuaries, and the Duchess Fund database were reviewed for evidence of reproductive disease or surgery. One-hundred and six female potbellied pigs were evaluated and uterine neoplasia was identified in 17 animals; tissues were available for 13 of these. Uterine leiomyoma was diagnosed in 11 of 13 cases, leiomyosarcoma in 1 of 13 cases, and undifferentiated sarcoma in 1 case. Pigs presented with clinical signs including abdominal distension or vaginal bleeding or were subclinical and identified during ovariohysterectomy. Tumors ranged from microscopic to 45 kg, were often multiple, and primarily involved the uterine horns. Hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome-stained sections were evaluated for morphological features of human and animal leiomyomas; immunohistochemistry to detect smooth muscle actin was also performed. The cellular pattern/morphology and variable degree of fibroplasia of the leiomyomas were similar to that reported for human fibroids. These results support further investigation of uterine leiomyomas in potbellied pigs as a potentially valuable animal model for studying human fibroids.
