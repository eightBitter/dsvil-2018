## Data Visualization with R

Speaker: Alison

- http://rdocumentation.org
  - good place to get a sense of R packages, popularity, usage, etc
- tidyverse: a series of packages that work well together and work with tidy data
- ggplot is a good visualization package to learn; there are other related packages (ggviz) that use the same syntax
- ordered categories in R are called factors (remember category vs number)
- cheat sheets
  - dplyr cheat sheet
  - ggplot2 cheat sheet
  - tidyverse cheat sheet
- there are a plethora of other viz tools, including interactive visualizations. see slides for this list
  - htmlwidgets - web interactive graphs
  - r2d3 - create d3 graphs using R

### Activity

  - small multiples = taking multiple lines in a chart and breaking those up to one line per chart
    - facet_wrap(~collection_type) breaks up into subplots based on collection_type
  - look for Help in R Studio to find cheat sheets
  - ggsave() can use other params other than inches, such as dpi
  - ggsave() can save to multiple image types: png, svg, pdf, tiff, etc
    - see help menu for both of these

### Wrap up

  - there's a good intro to R and other intro courses in [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)

## Lightning Talks

### Colab Notebooks - Luke Aeschleman

  - jupyter notebooks in Google Drive?
    - documentation and python code application in Google Drive

### Entrepreneurship and Data: The Library Can Help Your Pitch! - Emily Boyd

  - statista is a good database resource for consumer data, including data sources
  - creating a safe space where young entrepreneurs can pitch ideas and think through the entrepreneurship process

### Brief Experience in Two Areas of RDM Services - Anna J Dabrowski
  - Data service areas for RDM
    - training and consultations
    - training
      - workshops on a variety of RDM topics
        - built these as modules, so that she can tailor these for students, faculty, etc
      - working with subject liaisons for external outreach
    - consultation
      - scaling services to your resources
      - since there's only one data librarian, she scaled focus of services on big research groups instead of single researchers, so that she wouldn't get overwhelmed
      - two pieces of jargon
        - documentation vs metadata
        - archiving vs preservation

### Resources for Data - Driven Discovery & The Data Thesaurus - Tess Grynoch

  - http://nnlm.gov/data/thesaurus
  - data-driven discovery
  - thesaurus for data related terms
  - scope: giving librarians a common set of definitions for communication; not meant for machine indexing
    - could potentially be used as a common set of terms to use in grant applications and such

### Liaisons and Data Librarians: Strategic Partnering to Scale-up Data Services - Janelle Hedstrom

  - they have one Data Services Coordinator who is becoming overwhelmed. looking at strategies to involve subject liaisons in DSC responsibilities in order to scale up services
    - identifying needs and opportunities by discipline. liaisons don't learn everything, just a piece of data services
      - one person might be trained on data management planning; another might be trained on cleaning data
  - assessing needs & opportunities
    - survey based on COAR Task Force's Competencies for Research Data Management
    - looking at commonalities and interests

### The Case for Mode - Rachael Posey

  - the math term, not some special program

### Data Security @ NCSU Libraries - Hannah Rainey

### Keeping the Visualization Train Rolling - Jason Reed

  - talking about excitement at a conference, but not following through when they get back to work
  - instead of blocking off "research time"; set a block for a specific purpose/project
  - look to see if there's already a community of practice at your institution to connect with
  - offer to be a guinea pig for a relevant library workshop
  - for your own projects, think about what story you want to tell
  - take the initiative to share information/visualizations instead of waiting for somebody to ask for something

### Data Information Literacy - Mary Ellen Sloane
