This legislation would increase government accountability and transparency, while lessening the burden on small businesses by requiring federal agencies to post regulatory guidance documents online in an easy to find location. The bill is a House companion to S.2296, introduced by U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).
 
To circumvent responsibility and the legal rule-making process, the previous Administration had federal agencies issue ""guidance"" to serve as de facto regulations.


	""The Obama Administration made an art of evading public scrutiny by replacing formal rule-making with a stream of 'guidance,' 'bulletins' and 'statements of policy,'"" The Wall Street Journal wrote.


	While the regulations themselves were often erroneous and harmful to businesses, they also created undue burden in compliance as the guidance took on many different forms – blog posts, memos, letters, and news releases.


	The GOOD Act would bring clarity to the process by forcing all federal agencies to publish guidance documents on their website.

""Our out-of-control regulatory system represents roughly $2 trillion in cost on the economy and American small businesses every single year,"" Walker said. ""Worse yet, federal agencies are going around the rule-process to avoid accountability and oversight. If agencies expect the small businesses of North Carolina to comply with their burdensome rules, they should at a minimum make the information available and easily accessible.""

“In addition to facing onerous federal regulations, American businesses are also expected to follow regulatory guidance issued by agencies,"" Johnson said. ""Yet, unlike the public rule-making process for regulations, federal agencies are not required to disseminate guidance broadly to the public for input, making it hard for businesses and industry groups to monitor and follow. This bill will lift the veil of secrecy by requiring federal agencies to post regulatory guidance documents in a centralized location on their websites. This common sense bill would provide much needed transparency to American businesses and consumers.”

The GOOD Act has received praise from Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). ""Requiring vastly more disclosure, ensuring that federal agencies post all guidance documents online is a sensible and essential step to beginning to hold federal agencies accountable for their actions,"" Clyde Wane Crews, vice president for policy at CEI said.

As Hazel and Sorjonen write, ""a tax system with a 20 percent corporate tax rate and a modern territorial tax system will boost economic growth here at home and level the playing field for U.S. businesses and workers — including P&G’s U.S. employees here in Greensboro.""

Read the op-ed in its entirety here and below:

Congress is in the midst of moving a tax bill that is essential to the United States’ economic future. Allow us an opportunity to introduce some facts on why it is so important to our company, our workers and our community.


	Procter & Gamble sells consumer products in more than 180 countries and territories. We have 25 manufacturing sites located in 19 U.S. states and territories, as well as nearly 90 manufacturing sites in foreign countries, where we manufacture products close to the consumers we serve worldwide.


	Here in Greensboro, we proudly employ nearly 1,200 people between two manufacturing facilities. Within North Carolina, P&G purchases about $995 million of products and services from more than 495 suppliers.


	At P&G, we believe tax reform is crucial for both our company and our country. Why? The U.S. tax system puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. P&G has been a global company for more than 100 of our 180 years. In fact, one in five of P&G’s U.S.-based jobs support our international business, in areas such as manufacturing, marketing, innovation and supply chain management.


	So, when P&G succeeds in international markets, it means we succeed here at home, too.


	However, the U.S. corporate tax rate is among the highest in the developed world at 35 percent. The current global average for developed countries is about 24 percent, and countries are lowering their rates further, creating a downward trend. This makes it harder for P&G and other U.S.-headquartered businesses — small and large — to compete with peer companies headquartered overseas. It also reduces the competitiveness of the U.S. economy as a place to do business and create jobs. The Congress is currently considering legislation that would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.


	Congress is also considering legislation that would move the U.S. tax code from a worldwide corporate income tax system to what is known as a territorial tax system. This would help American companies, including P&G, compete on a level playing field. Unlike P&G, our competitors headquartered outside the United States — who already operate under a territorial system — do not pay additional tax to their home countries when they sell products outside their home countries. Because 60 percent of P&G’s sales are global, the current U.S. tax code puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Other American companies are in a similar position.


	As members of Congress debate whether or not to pass tax reform in the coming weeks, it is important to remember that economic growth and jobs in our community depend on having a competitive U.S. tax system. The details will matter, but a tax system with a 20 percent corporate tax rate and a modern territorial tax system will boost economic growth here at home and level the playing field for U.S. businesses and workers — including P&G’s U.S. employees here in Greensboro.","December 11, 2017","Tax Reform","null"

""We cannot dig our hands into a hole $20 trillion deep to bail out insurance companies. Even worse, we will be adding insult to injury by masking the failures of Obamacare at the expense of hardworking taxpayers. The people of North Carolina are already paying enough because of Obamacare’s pitfalls. Instead of the executive branch issuing unconstitutional payments to bail out insurance companies, the Senate should continue working until they have passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Their constituents are tired of their inability to fulfill their promise.""

The CSR payments are illegal because Congress, who holds the constitutional power of the purse, never authorized the payments. They are the center of a 2014 lawsuit where House Republicans sued the Obama administration on the constitutionality of the payments directly to insurance companies, practically serving as a bail out. A Federal District Court judge agreed and ordered the payments had to be halted.

According to The New York Times: 

""Congress never provided explicit authority for the spending, she ruled. 'Such an appropriation cannot be inferred,' the judge said in her opinion. She blocked further spending under the program but said that order would be suspended pending an appeal by the Obama administration.""

In April, the Trump administration announced it would temporarily continue CSR payments. Following that decision Walker said that ""The Constitution provides that ‘No money may be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of Appropriations made by Law.’  

""Congress has made no appropriation for Obamacare cost sharing reduction payments,""Walker added. ""Therefore, we believe making these payments without congressional approval is both clearly illegal and unconstitutional, as the district court held in House v. Price.""","August 16, 2017","Health Care","null"

	""We sent a bill to President Obama’s desk that would have repealed much of the law, and was promptly — and unsurprisingly — vetoed.

	This op-ed follows a similar effort by Walker and Lee in 2015, calling for a stronger reconcilation bill that worked to ""repeal as much of Obamacare as possible.""","December 9, 2016","Health Care","Since 2010 everyone in the Republican party has agreed that Obamacare must be repealed. Most Republican members of Congress — ourselves included — were elected, and reelected, on the promise that we would take any opportunity possible to end this partisan, ham-handed, and unconstitutional law.


	When Republicans attained control of both the House and Senate in 2015, we saw an opportunity to lay the foundation for full repeal under a possible future Republican president. To that end, we penned an article in National Review calling for Congress to send President Obama a bill repealing Obamacare. “It is more important than ever for Republicans in Congress to honor the promises we have made to the American people,” we wrote. “We can do this, before the end of the year, through a procedure known as ‘budget reconciliation.’”


	House and Senate Republicans followed through on this promise. We sent a bill to President Obama’s desk that would have repealed much of the law, and was promptly — and unsurprisingly — vetoed. But this exercise was not, by any measure, a fruitless effort.


	That bill, H.R. 3762, established the minimum standards against which any future Obamacare repeal bills would be measured. It zeroed out Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates, scrapped the taxes, revived health savings accounts, and rolled back the Medicaid expansion and subsidies. Majorities in the House and Senate are on record voting for all of these items. We can do it again.


	But there is no denying that any new reconciliation repeal bill in the next Congress will have a different outcome. This time, when the House and Senate send such a bill to the White House, the incoming president has said he will sign it. That is why it is so important that we get this repeal bill right.


	And the bare minimum simply is not enough this time.


	A minimum effort could end up hurting many Americans. Specifically, the law’s many insurance mandates drive up health costs and force individuals to violate their deeply held religious convictions. When government bureaucrats and politicians decide that every insurance policy must cover free doctor visits and abortifacients, Americans who don’t need those options end up paying more for products they don’t want. That’s great for the insurance companies, but not for taxpayers or consumers."

					Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them.


					In her own words, Betty Hilliard has been blessed with a career that allowed her to retire early, and she’s been using her time to selflessly care for others. She volunteers hours of her time to serve her community helping out at many organizations in the Greensboro area:

The Barnabas Network

					Betty spends about ten hours a month volunteering at The Barnabas Network, which helps provide furniture to struggling families as they transition out of homelessness, abusive situations, or the loss of a home. She was formerly a board member and is on a committee for establishing a retail store.

Ten Thousand Villages

					Betty is filling in as the manager of Ten Thousand Villages in Greensboro where she volunteers for more than 50 hours a month. Ten Thousand Villages is a fair trade retailer that sells items that are made largely by women in developing nations. The sale of these items help these women provide food, shelter and educational opportunities for their families.

StepUp Greensboro

					Betty volunteers about 20 hours a month at StepUp Greensboro, which works to create opportunities through jobs and life-skills training. There she assists with the Job Readiness Training Week and helps people prepare for job interviews. “This program gives so many that first chance to ‘Step Up’ their lives, to change to improve their situations, to be able to provide for their families and in many instances to begin to pay it forward for others,” Hilliard said. “It enables individuals to begin to value themselves and to transform into productive, happy, and fulfilled people.”

					 
First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro

					Betty also volunteers in many ways through her church. At First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro, she volunteers in the kitchen, serving meals as a Team leader. She also works with “Circle of Friends” to provide meals for bereaved families and delivers “Mobile Meals.”


					“The way Betty restlessly serves our community is inspirational. It was amazing to discover all of the organizations she works with and all of the lives she has touched.” Walker said. “I am thrilled we can honor her selfless work and celebrate how she has used her life to be an example for how we are all called to help our neighbors.”

	“Good evening.

	 

	“Tonight, you’ve heard how we are working with the new Administration to deliver on our promises and build a safe, strong and proud America. After eight years of the weakest economic growth in a century, we are now  answering back with the strongest legislative record in decades.

	 

	“We have record low unemployment. Companies are bringing back jobs, as well as their revenue that has been kept overseas for far too long.

	 

	“The number is still growing, but already, right now, more than three million Americans have received bonuses in the wake of this new tax reform. Not to mention the 90 percent of Americans starting to see more money in their paychecks just this week.

	 

	“The excitement about our economic strength is not only with Republicans. Democrats and Independents are feeling more positive about the economy than anytime in the past decade. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has paved the way for prosperity and Americans, benefitting all of our communities.

	 

	“This is what happens when Washington listens to the voters and focuses on policies that help everyone, not just a select few.

	 

	“In 2016, voters sent a clear message by casting three million more votes for congressional Republicans than their Democratic counterparts. While we are keeping our promises, we cannot rest on any past accomplishments. There is energy from the left to resist and then resurrect failed policies that benefit only the well-connected in Washington.

	 

	“While we continue to reap the benefits of less government intrusiveness, economic growth, and the progress in protecting life of all ages, it is imperative we keep pushing forward in 2018.

	 

	“I get asked a good bit about the President’s behavior. It would be hypocritical of me to act as if I approve of some of the past actions. Yet, it is also undeniable that our country is soaring back at record levels. The President is blowing gaping holes in the political establishment allowing the legislative branch to seize this opportunity and pass items promised to the American people for decades.

	 

	“Just as the President mentioned tonight, we must keep rebuilding our military and reinstate a peace through strength strategy. We should responsibly invest in our broken infrastructure. And we must insist on fair trade policies that prioritize American businesses.

	 

	“But most importantly, we must keep promoting policies that bring prosperity to people in all of our communities and we must keep communicating our message of why less government overreach in our lives is always better.

	 

	“We should not be satisfied with simply making an argument, but always, each of us, strive to make a difference. May God bless and may we have the courage to follow.”"

“What this letter is about is whether or not a foreign company will be able to use legal gymnastics in order to hurt a U.S. company that employs more than 150 people in Greensboro,” said Budd. “What I’ve tried to underline for the International Trade Commission is that if they rule in favor of the foreign company, it would have a major negative impact on an American company’s ability to compete.  That, in turn, would jeopardize manufacturing jobs in our state.  Free trade means everyone has to play by the rules, not twist the law into a pretzel to gain a competitive advantage.”

	 
“The government cannot get involved in picking winners and losers in our economy – especially when those decisions hurt our small businesses in North Carolina,” said Walker.“Preventing Diebold from selling and manufacturing their products in the United States would be devastating to the North Carolinians who depend on the company for jobs and economic growth.”","June 1, 2017","Jobs and Economic Growth","null"
"1528294531-98","https://walker.house.gov/media-center/press-releases","next ›","https://walker.house.gov/media-center/press-releases?page=6","Walker Introduces the Universal Charitable Giving Act to Incentivize Donations to Charity in Tax Reform","https://walker.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walker-introduces-universal-charitable-giving-act-incentivize-donations","Walker Introduces the Universal Charitable Giving Act to Incentivize Donations to Charity in Tax Reform","WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) introduced a bill that would incentivize charitable giving for low and middle income earning individuals and families.

The Universal Charitable Giving Act establishes an universal charitable deduction for individuals and married couples who do not itemize, in addition to the standard deduction. This would be an above-the-line deduction up to one-third of the standard deduction – about $2,100 for individuals and $4,200 for married couples.


	As reported by The Hill: ""Walker’s bill would allow taxpayers who take the standard deduction to also deduct their charitable contributions up to an amount equal to one-third of the standard deduction. The standard deduction for married couples under current law is $12,700 and would be increased to $24,000 under the GOP’s framework.""

To better explain the importance of the Universal Charitable Giving Act, what it does, and how it helps charities, Walker released a video (above) featuring the Baptist Children's Home of North Carolina. In the video, J. Keith Henry, Chief Operating Officer for Baptist Children's Homes of North Carolina explains that upwards of 65 percent of their budget comes from charitable donations, and that any policy that discourages giving to charity could have a harmful impact on their services. 

A key aspect of the recently released GOP Tax Reform Framework from the White House and Congress is to double the standard deduction so that lower and middle income families keep more of their paycheck and have more income that is not taxed. 


	Under the current tax system around 70 percent of tax filers claim the standard deduction. Estimates have shown, under the new GOP Tax Reform Framework, that number would rise to 95 percent.

	 

	With current law, only taxpayers who itemize their deductions can deduct charitable donations to qualifying organizations. As a potential unintended consequence of the tax plan, the doubling of the standard deduction will lower the number of itemizers and likely decrease charitable giving incentives for many taxpayers.

	 

	The Universal Charitable Giving Act incentivizes charitable giving for low and middle income taxpayers. It would not only help individuals and families who would likely stop itemizing their deductions under the new tax plan, but would also encourage taxpayers who already claim the standard deduction to give the charities and causes they believe in.

	 

	This bill is focused on helping charities, and the lower and middle class. In fiscal year 2017, roughly 71% of the tax expenditures for charitable giving will be claimed by taxpayers who earn $200,000 a year or more. By broadening the base of people who can deduct charitable donations, this bill aims to empower lower and middle income earners to direct funds willingly to socially productive organizations they wish to support.


	You can read the full text of the legislation here. 


	The bill has already garnered attention of prominent organizations such as the Alliance for Charitable Reform, Charitable Giving Coalition and the Independent Sector.

""The Charitable Giving Coalition (CGC) applauds Congressman Mark Walker (R-NC-6) for standing up for America’s charitable organizations and the communities they serve,"" Jason Lee, chair of the Charitable Giving Coalition said. ""Congressman Walker’s bill expands good tax policy, providing an incentive to more Americans to invest in their communities through charitable giving.

The Taxpayers Before Insurers Act would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to pay the $3.5 billion it has taken from taxpayers back to the U.S. Treasury or face a 50 percent cut in its operating budget.

					 

					To mitigate the high costs of Obamacare's mandates, the bill created three programs, one of which was the Transitional Reinsurance Program. The three-year reinsurance program required the HHS to collect $25 billion from insurers. Of this, the law mandated that HHS send $5 billion directly to the U.S. Treasury to pay down Obamacare's costs on the American people: $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016. The other $20 billion was to be paid back to insurers for covering patients in the exchanges. Despite $4 billion already being due, the Treasury has only received $500 million. Instead, the money required by law to be paid to the Treasury alone is now being sent to well­-connected insurance companies.

					 

					“In Washington, this kind of lawlessness gets overlooked too much. Federal bureaucrats are not above the laws they force upon the American people,” Walker said. “My bill is simple: I want HHS to follow the law it helped write.”

					 

					“This should not be a partisan idea: the government should follow the law and prioritize the people it serves over big insurance companies,” Walker added.

					 

					Representative Walker also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner to explain why he introduced the bill.

					 

					The Taxpayers Before Insurers Act is supported by American for Tax Reform and Citizens Against Government Waste. In a letter to Walker, Grover Norquist, the President of Americans for Tax Reform said “The $3.5 billion in Obamacare reinsurance corporate welfare payments are merely the latest effort by the administration to ignore the law to the benefit of monied special interests.”","July 14, 2016","Health Care","null"

	“Our office takes great pride in recognizing members of our community who go above and beyond the call of duty to serve others,” Walker said. “For over a decade, Bill Moody has pledged his time to provide a joyful Christmas for emotionally, physically and mentally challenged children all across North Carolina. In light of the season, I’m honored to present Bill with this small token of our appreciation for his many hours dedicated to giving children the gift of joy, hope and laughter,” Walker added.


	“When I started around ten years ago as Santa Claus, I quickly discovered I had been given a unique gift to the least understood children in society,” Moody said. “I have never taken a single penny from any appearance as Santa Claus. I have been blessed with a look and the personality to make children happy and it isn’t right to profit from it. God has been good to me and I need to return His blessings to those I meet,” Moody added.


	Moody has played the role of Santa Claus for over a decade. He primarily works through the Friendship Ministry at Osborne Baptist Church in Eden, NC, which is an organization for emotionally, physically and mentally challenged people, and the Family Support Network of Greater Forsyth County. Moody makes appearances for companies and charges a fee that is entirely directed toward charities, such as the Toys-for-Tots program.

	“When I talk to the people of North Carolina, a common sentiment I hear is the American Dream is fading,"" Walker said. ""This concern becomes reality driving on Front St. in Burlington or Steele St. in Sanford, observing the vanished local banks that used to serve as the epicenter of growth for our community. Burdening regulations have diminished the backbone of our local economy and the true cost can only be measured in small businesses not started, workers not hired and dreams not filled. With our vote on the Financial CHOICE Act, we can start to reverse course and upend the country’s historically slow economic recovery, while placing the stiffest penalties in history on Wall Street abuse.”


	In 2010 (the year the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law), North Carolina's 6th District's housed nine community banks including CommunityOne Bank in Asheboro, NewBridge Bank in Greensboro, and Mid-Carolina Bank in Burlington. Today, that number is only two as Dodd-Frank regulations have forced closures and mergers across North Carolina. In fact, community banks are closing at a national rate of one per day. Meanwhile, the five largest banks in the country have grown their domestic assets by more than 40 percent during the same time. 


	Instead of fixing the causes at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, the 2,300-plus page Dodd-Frank bill codified into law “too big to fail” and taxpayer-funded bailouts. And instead of being tough on Wall Street, it put many local banks out of business because they did not have the resources to navigate the expansive and costly regulations. The effect has been seen in communities nationwide.  


	Dodd-Frank has also been noted as a major cause of our ongoing economic recovery – which is the slowest and weakest in 70 years. 

The Financial CHOICE Act reins in Dodd-Frank and gives local banks and small businesses an opportunity for success. The bill would protect taxpayers from paying for more Wall Street bailouts, forcing failing banks and financial institutions to go through bankruptcy like any other company.


	The Financial CHOICE Act also holds Wall Street accountable by imposing the toughest penalties for financial fraud in history. Additionally, the bill cuts the deficit by $33.6 billion over 10 years. 


	Small, community banks account for 54 percent of small business loans across the country. Small businesses make up 64 percent of net new private sector jobs.  By empowering community banks, the Financial CHOICE Act will help grow jobs and the economy in North Carolina.","June 8, 2017","Accountability","null"

	Larry Wagner has been the volunteer Archery Instructor at Victory Junction Camp since 2005. Victory Junction is a camp that enriches the lives of children with chronic medical conditions and serious illnesses by providing life-changing camp experiences. When Mr. Wagner began volunteering at Victory Junction, he found a place that included three of his passions:  archery, kids, and volunteering. Over the past twelve years, Mr. Wagner has built the archery program that has inspired countless children to participate in the sport of archery, and he has developed special bows to accommodate children in wheelchairs. His creativity is a model for other camps, even as far away as Australia. One of Mr. Wagner’s former campers, Kyla, now shoots for her school’s archery team and has placed 3rd in Special Olympics.

GOP Maps a Road to Nowhere in November
The Wall Street Journal

	By Mark Walker

	January 15, 2018


	Despite the constant media portrayal of disarray, 2017 was a productive year for the first unified Republican government in a decade. Not only did we pass a once-in-a-generation tax reform, we repealed ObamaCare’s most onerous and unpopular provision, the individual mandate.


	Democrats should be anxious about heading into midterm elections as Americans reap the benefits of tax reform and deregulation. If Republicans maintain our momentum, we can retain our majorities in the House and Senate. Yet I fear we may be giving Democrats a fighting chance by bringing back a practice that epitomizes swamp-style politics: earmarking.


	Officially banned in 2011, earmarks give members of Congress the ability to direct federal spending toward specific projects, usually in their own districts. Conservatives traditionally oppose such giveaways, but Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that the House will look into reviving the practice. He shouldn’t bow to the demands of members who claim earmarking is a legitimate part of Congress’s power of the purse.


	This bad idea is gaining traction partly because most House Republicans took their seats after the 2011 ban. They have little memory of past abuses like Alaska’s “Bridge to Nowhere.” They never had to endure the meetings where lobbyists pressured them to grovel before the Appropriations Committee for pork. The moniker “cardinals” for subcommittee chairmen is an anachronism; they no longer have unilateral powers to redirect billions in spending on a whim.


	When earmarks were allowed and encouraged, bills passed on shady favors and chumminess rather than on their merits. This practice helped produce what we now call the swamp. It wasn’t so long ago that the GOP used a platform of banning earmarks and controlling spending to help ride a major political wave and take control of the House. This message was a precursor to President Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” and end a status quo that benefits Washington insiders over ordinary Americans.


	An earmark revival—even as the U.S. courts trillion-dollar deficits—would risk handing Democrats a tool to transform their “resistance” into a political force capable of achieving tea-party-style electoral victories. If Republicans bring back earmarks, you can bet that Democrats plant the blame of every subsequent earmark on Republicans. It’s only a matter of time before there is another politically catastrophic “Bridge to Nowhere.”


	Earmarks also lead to bad policy. I am willing to listen to reform proposals, but historically earmarks have opened the gates to out-of-control spending as members compete with one another to bring home the bacon. The price for every bill tends to rise as members hold their affirmative votes until money for their own pet projects are slipped into legislation. Earmarks for Medicare and Medicaid greased the legislative gears to pass ObamaCare, a bad policy that plagued American families with year after year of premium hikes.


	President Trump recently said he supports bringing back earmarks, apparently hoping it will make legislation easier to pass. But if the political backlash helps Democrats take the House, the legislative agenda will consist simply of impeaching Mr. Trump for whatever the latest controversy is. Democrats likely will abuse the power of Congress to ramp up the Russia investigation and subpoena anyone who ever drank Russian vodka. (For the record, I’d be safe.)


	Instead of looking to tried-and-failed methods of the past, Republicans should keep our focus on fulfilling the promises made by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration to the American people. Reviving earmarks would threaten to bring our party’s momentum to a screeching halt.","January 16, 2018","Accountability","null"

“From the beaches of Normandy to the foothills of North Carolina, our veterans have valiantly served our nation and our community,"" Walker said. ""They deserve better than to die on secret VA waiting lists, anticipating the care they were promised when they put their country before themselves. The Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act will reform the VA to better serve our heroes and hold federal bureaucrats accountable for their unacceptable failures in caring for our nation’s veterans. As this bill goes to the President’s desk, another important promise is kept.”

This legislation, having already passed the Senate, now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law.


	In 2014, the country was horrified as news reports came out of the Phoenix VA – and then others across the country – detailing veterans dying on secret VA waiting lists. Records were hidden, cover ups occurred, and federal employees put themselves over the lives of veterans. This was unacceptable and we can't let it happen again. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act will allow us to change course and bring accountability and better care to the VA – the care our heroes deserve. 


	There are more than 750,000 veterans living in North Carolina, making up about ten percent of the adult population. Guilford County has the fourth highest veteran population in the state with more than 32,000. Constituents of North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District generally use one of three local VA medical centers in Durham, Fayetteville, or Salisbury.

The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act is supported by the following veterans organizations:

The American Legion

	“This legislation, as currently written, will provide the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs the authorities to improve accountability and raise employee performance and morale.  We are impressed by the speed by which Congress acted to move this critical legislation forward to the President’s desk in a bipartisan manner. We look forward to this bill becoming law.” –Charles E. Schmidt, National Commander

Concerned Veterans for America

	“For years a toxic culture has plagued the Department of Veterans Affairs, but the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act will be a meaningful step toward turning the troubled department around. Finally, Secretary Shulkin will be empowered with the authority to quickly remove those who under-perform, neglect patients, or even engage in criminal activity. We believe this historic piece of legislation will help usher in a new era of integrity and accountability at the department entrusted with caring for our heroes. We thank Chairman Roe, Senator Rubio, and concerned citizens across the country who pushed relentlessly to generate support from both sides of the aisle and make this reform a reality.” –Dan Caldwell, Policy Director

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America

	“Given that the scandal in Phoenix alerted the country to the outrageous state of the VA health care system nearly three years ago, this change is long overdue. IAVA applauds the leadership of Majority Leader McCarthy and Chairman Roe to hold a House vote on the Senate-passed bill that will empower the VA to remove bad-acting employees. IAVA and our members have fought relentlessly to give the VA Secretary the tools needed to address workforce accountability and save veterans’ lives, and we are extremely pleased that final passage into law is within reach.” –IAVA Founder and CEO Paul Rieckhoff

Paralyzed Veterans of America

	“No other large healthcare system rivals VA's competence to deliver specialized services at a national level, such as spinal cord injury and disease and polytrauma care, or synthesizes access to healthcare, benefits, support, and peer mentorship better than VA. But what VA needs most right now is the one 'ability' it presently lacks and can no longer be taken for granted — accountability. Whether that means better protecting whistleblowers, shortening the reprimand process, or recouping ill-gotten bonuses and relocation expenses, achieving a state of being answerable to the public, the Congress, and most importantly, veterans, will be dictated by the worst behavior the VA Secretary has to tolerate. This bill will be a major step toward having to tolerate such behavior no more."" –Sherman Gillums, Executive Director

Veterans of Foreign Wars

	“The VFW wants Secretary Shulkin to have the authority to manage his people in a manner expected of all senior executives, public or private. The VFW wants the secretary to weed out the nonperformers and those whose personal conduct brings doubt and dishonor upon thousands of dedicated employees. And the VFW wants this bill passed into law, because maintaining the status quo doesn’t work for those who have borne the battle.” –VFW National Commander Brian Duffy

Vietnam Veterans of America

	“Vietnam Veterans of America has been advocating strongly for much greater accountability from VA management since our founding in 1978. We have done so in public statements and countless testimonies on Capitol Hill. This statute is a real milestone in that journey; a journey that at times seemed to be a very lonely effort. We are gratified to see this day.” –John Rowan, VVA National President","June 13, 2017","Veterans","null"

""20.2 trillion. Our national debt is more than $20.2 trillion. Let’s put it this way: each American's share of the national debt is $62,000.

	Walker voted in favor of the legislation, which would balance the budget over 10 years and offers strong conservative reforms that put the government on path to fiscal responsibility.

The discussions included a bipartisan group of lawmakers, 70 Presidents and Chancellors of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and private sector leaders from Walmart, John Deere, Bank of America, Starbucks, McDonald's, Google, and Koch Industries. The daylong conference also featured a keynote address from Benjamin Watson, NFL player for the Baltimore Ravens and recent Bart Starr award winner.

""At a time when our nation has record high small business confidence and rising rates of young entrepreneurship, it is essential that we engage in a dynamic dialogue about how to prepare our next generation of leaders for the new American economy,"" Walker said. ""By building bridges across communities and business sectors, and by forging relationships between private and public organizations, I believe we can work together for the betterment of our students. The 2018 HBCU Fly-In served as the nucleus for these and other important conversations. Senator Scott and I were humbled and excited at the participation and engagement.""

As reported by Inside Higher Ed:

""HBCU leaders this week got a chance to reacquaint members of Congress and administration officials with their priorities at the Hill event organized by Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, and Representative Mark Walker, a North Carolina Republican.""


	...


	""But Republican lawmakers and HBCU leaders argue year-round Pell Grants wouldn’t have been restored by Congress last year without those meetings. And Harry L. Williams, president and CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, cites the relationships historically black colleges are building in Washington as much as any concrete policy developments.""


	...


	""At the event, Walker cited personal reasons for caring about the success of black colleges -- his wife attended one. His district also includes North Carolina A&T University, the nation's largest HBCU. Scott said he began organizing the meetings last year to address untapped potential in minority communities. Working with Republicans in Congress is also less toxic for college presidents than working with this White House.


	""The payoffs of working with Republicans at the federal level already are apparent, Williams said. Chief among those is restoration of year-round Pell, the top priority pushed by college presidents at last year’s event.


	""That was also a policy goal shared by a wide range of higher ed advocacy groups, particularly those that represent two-year colleges. But Williams said the change wouldn’t have come about were it not for relationships cultivated with Republicans like Walker and Scott.""

	This legislation would save taxpayer money and bring needed accountability to federal agencies by requiring them to report on the status of Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (IG) recommendations in their annual budget justification. Walker introduced the GAO-IG Act in March.

This bipartisan legislation will make government better, more accountable, and save taxpayer dollars.”


	The bill is a House companion to S.2276, introduced by U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).


	These changes represent potential savings of at least $87 billion for taxpayers as agencies will be forced to improve based on IG and GAO recommendations or will be required to provide justification for not implementing the recommendations.

	The joint statement was issued by Congresswoman Renee Ellmers (NC-2), Congressman Walter Jones (NC-3), Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-5), Congressman Mark Walker (NC-6), Congressman David Rouzer (NC-7), Congressman Richard Hudson (NC-8), Congressman Robert Pittenger (NC-9), Congressman Patrick McHenry (NC-10), Congressman Mark Meadows (NC-11), and Congressman George Holding (NC-13). 

â€œLast Friday we were horrified to watch the terrorist attacks unfold in Paris. To see innocent lives taken by a group of radical Islamic terrorists was sickening and our prayers go out to all those impacted by this unspeakable tragedy.

â€œIn the days since, we have been deeply troubled to learn one of the terrorists who committed this atrocity may have come to Europe posing as a Syrian refugee. With the massive influx of Syrian refugees to Europe, this was always a threat and, regrettably, now itâ€™s been realized.

â€œGiven this development we have serious concerns about the ongoing resettlement of Syrian refugees to the communities we represent across North Carolina. As a delegation, we join with Governor McCrory in calling for the Obama Administration to immediately cease sending Syrian refugees to our state. We believe this is a common sense step and applaud Governor McCrory for his leadership on the issue. 

â€œThe Paris attacks highlighted that ISIL is not contained and still poses a grave threat to Western Democracies. Blocking the flow of Syrian refugees until we can better understand and address security risks they may pose is a necessary step to protect our state and homeland.â€","November 17, 2015","Foreign Affairs","null"

“I am thankful the President has taken this important step in empowering federal agencies to refocus their efforts towards combatting the opioid crisis. Congress has passed laws that provide resources to confront this epidemic, but as we learned last week in our Opioid Crisis Tour throughout North Carolina, more action is clearly needed. We will remain committed to working with local law enforcement, first responders, and local government to stop the overwhelming hardship this is causing to the families of our community.”

According to Roll Call, ""the declaration would direct all federal agencies to make the crisis their number one priority. It would include awareness and prevention programs and allow the federal government to work with states to redistribute already-available grants that support substance abuse efforts.""


	Last week, Walker hosted a two-day, seven-stop opioid crisis tour across North Carolina to better understand the full scope of the opioid epidemic and to get a firsthand account of the realities, burdens, and struggles of opioid addiction in North Carolina. Read more about the Opioid Crisis Tour in a story in the Washington Examiner here. 

As the story notes, ""since 1999, opioid-related deaths in North Carolina have increased by 800 percent, nationwide drug overdoses now kill more Americans than gun homicides and car crashes combined.""


	In 2016, more than two million Americans had an addiction to prescription or illicit opioids. Since 2000, over 300,000 Americans have died from overdoses involving opioids.

The letter is in response to “questions asked during a recent Senate Budget Committee Hearing about an executive branch nominee’s adherence to the Christian faith, suggesting that such beliefs disqualified the nominee from service.”


		The video of that exchange can be seen here and above, where U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticizes Russ Vought, nominee to serve as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, for his Christian beliefs.

The letter states, in part:

""While there is continuous debate about the scope and meaning of the religion clauses in the First Amendment, the text of Article VI has been clear: no religious test shall ever (emphasis added) be required as a qualification to any public office or public trust under the United States.""

""The free exercise of religion means the ability to practice your faith without fear of punishment by the government. The government violates that right if it determines which faith or non-faith practices are valid or which aspects of a particular faith are legitimate. As such, we urge you to make clear in your forthcoming guidance that the scope and meaning of Article VI has not changed: no religious test will ever be required to serve in the government of the United States.""

	This legislation would save taxpayer money and bring needed accountability to federal agencies by requiring them to report on the status of Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (IG) recommendations in their annual budget justification. Walker introduced the GAO-IG Act in March.

“Right now, North Carolina taxpayers are having their hard-earned money wasted by federal bureaucrats who have been told how to improve and become more efficient, but refuse to follow recommendations,” Walker said in March. “That is unacceptable. This bipartisan legislation will make government better, more accountable, and save taxpayer dollars.”


	The bill is a House companion to S.2276, introduced by U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).


	These changes represent potential savings of at least $87 billion for taxpayers as agencies will be forced to improve based on IG and GAO recommendations or will be required to provide justification for not implementing the recommendations.

The Taxpayers Before Insurers Act would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to pay the $3.5 billion it has taken from taxpayers back to the U.S. Treasury or face a 50 percent cut in its operating budget.

					 

					To mitigate the high costs of Obamacare's mandates, the bill created three programs, one of which was the Transitional Reinsurance Program. The three-year reinsurance program required the HHS to collect $25 billion from insurers. Of this, the law mandated that HHS send $5 billion directly to the U.S. Treasury to pay down Obamacare's costs on the American people: $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016. The other $20 billion was to be paid back to insurers for covering patients in the exchanges. Despite $4 billion already being due, the Treasury has only received $500 million. Instead, the money required by law to be paid to the Treasury alone is now being sent to well­-connected insurance companies.

					 

					“In Washington, this kind of lawlessness gets overlooked too much. Federal bureaucrats are not above the laws they force upon the American people,” Walker said. “My bill is simple: I want HHS to follow the law it helped write.”

					 

					“This should not be a partisan idea: the government should follow the law and prioritize the people it serves over big insurance companies,” Walker added.

					 

					Representative Walker also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner to explain why he introduced the bill.

					 

					The Taxpayers Before Insurers Act is supported by American for Tax Reform and Citizens Against Government Waste. In a letter to Walker, Grover Norquist, the President of Americans for Tax Reform said “The $3.5 billion in Obamacare reinsurance corporate welfare payments are merely the latest effort by the administration to ignore the law to the benefit of monied special interests.”","July 14, 2016","Spending Cuts and Debt","null"

“President Trump made the right call in deeming these payments unlawful. Under no circumstance should Congress attempt to expand Obamacare by cutting a check for President Obama’s bailout of insurance companies. Instead, Congress must fulfill the promise to repeal and replace Obamacare with high-quality, patient-centered health care.”

The CSR payments were illegal because Congress, who holds the constitutional power of the purse, never authorized the payments. They are the center of a 2014 lawsuit where House Republicans sued the Obama administration on the constitutionality of the payments directly to insurance companies, practically serving as a bail out. A Federal District Court judge agreed and ordered the payments had to be halted.

According to The New York Times: 

""Congress never provided explicit authority for the spending, she ruled. 'Such an appropriation cannot be inferred,' the judge said in her opinion. She blocked further spending under the program but said that order would be suspended pending an appeal by the Obama administration.""

In August, the Trump administration announced it would temporarily continue CSR payments. Following that decisionWalker said that ""we cannot dig our hands into a hole $20 trillion deep to bail out insurance companies.""

""Even worse, we will be adding insult to injury by masking the failures of Obamacare at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,"" Walker added. ""The people of North Carolina are already paying enough because of Obamacare’s pitfalls. Instead of the executive branch issuing unconstitutional payments to bail out insurance companies, the Senate should continue working until they have passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Their constituents are tired of their inability to fulfill their promise.”","October 13, 2017","Health Care","null"

“America’s prison system routinely turns low level offenders into hardened, repeat offenders. The FIRST STEP Act takes important steps to reverse this trend by expanding education and job training opportunities for prisoners, offering them a much-needed hand up to once again become productive members of society. Justice is not the same as heavy-handedness. The American story is a history of second chances, that’s why we must always ensure that after debts are paid, the path to redemption is paved.”


	According to the House Judiciary Committee ""the FIRST STEP Act implements a post-sentencing dynamic risk assessment system to determine an inmate’s risk of committing more crimes upon release from prison Under the legislation, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) would utilize effective recidivism reduction programs and provide incentives for inmates to participate in those programs. Ultimately, inmates could earn credits toward an alternative custody arrangement – such as a halfway house or home confinement – at the end of their prison sentence.""


	The legislation also enhances prison security by requiring the Director of BOP to provide a secure storage area outside the secure perimeter for employees to store firearms or to allow for vehicle lock boxes for firearms. It also requires the Director to provide de-escalation training as part of the regular training requirements of correctional officers.


	Additionally, the legislation provides more employment opportunities for inmates by expanding the federal prison industries program and extends the compassionate elderly release provision from the Second Chance Act that allows the prisoner to request for his or her compassionate release if he or she meets the requirements set out in the law.


	In April, Walker penned an op-ed in The Hill Congressional Black Caucus Chairman and U.S. Representative Cedric Richmond (D-La.) highlighting the need for criminal justice reform by Congress and calling on congressional leadership on both sides of the aisle to help facilitate action.


	""We have the opportunity to restore families and help people find redemption instead of condemnation,"" they wrote. ""Together, we are calling on congressional leadership – of both parties – to dedicate the resources and afford this issue the national attention it deserves.""

“Local banks used to serve as the epicenter of growth for our community, proudly thriving on Main Streets in our towns and serving as the source of capital for local businesses to start, expand, and grow.

The bill would change the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets under $10 billion (community banks) and for large banks with assets over $50 billion. The bill also would make changes to consumer mortgage and credit-reporting regulations and to the authorities of the agencies that regulate the financial industry.


	In 2010 (the year the Dodd–Frank Act was signed into law), North Carolina's 6th District's housed nine community banks including CommunityOne Bank in Asheboro, NewBridge Bank in Greensboro, and Mid-Carolina Bank in Burlington. Today, that number is only two as Dodd-Frank regulations have forced closures and mergers across North Carolina. In fact, community banks are closing at a national rate of one per day. Meanwhile, the five largest banks in the country have grown their domestic assets by more than 40 percent during the same time. 


	Instead of fixing the causes at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, the 2,300-plus page Dodd-Frank bill codified into law “too big to fail” and taxpayer-funded bailouts. And instead of being tough on Wall Street, it put many local banks out of business because they did not have the resources to navigate the expansive and costly regulations. The effect has been seen in communities nationwide.  


	Small, community banks account for 54 percent of small business loans across the country. Small businesses make up 64 percent of net new private sector jobs.

“North Carolina’s more than 700,000 veterans deserve better than to suffer for years on VA waiting lists or travel hours just to get the care they were promised when they put their country before themselves. Extending the Choice Program that helps get our heroes faster care closer to home and expanding assistance options for their family caregivers will help us keep our promise to our veterans, from the Greatest Generation to the current generation. The VA MISSION Act is an important step in our office’s work to serve each of those who have given selflessly to our nation.”

According to the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, the VA MISSION Act ""would streamline the department’s duplicative community care programs into one cohesive program; create a non-partisan process for reviewing VA’s assets to ensure veterans can access the care they have earned and expand the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Post-9/11 Caregiver Program to all eras."" The legislation, which has the support ofnearly 40 veterans service organizations, the VA, and the White House, would also extend the Veterans Choice Program, permitting veterans greater options to get faster care outside of the VA. 

Former North Carolina Senator Elizabeth Dole wrote an op-ed in The Hill supporting the VA MISSION Act. ""We will help millions of America’s hidden heroes, like Diane, who manage medications, schedule doctor’s appointments and rehab sessions, and provide daily personal hygiene and physical therapy to their veterans at home,"" she wrote.

One Small Step for Racial Diversity on Capitol Hill
McClatchy D.C. Bureau

	By: William Douglas

	April 10, 2018

Vashti Hinton is working in a place that some folks said would never hire her: Capitol Hill.


	“I had many people telling me that I wouldn’t be able to ever get a job here and it would be impossible because I wanted to wear my hair natural, I went to an HBCU, and I am a black woman.”


	Hinton, a North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University graduate, recently landed a job in the office of Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the first full time hire from a unique three-year-old internship program created by Reps. Alma Adams, D-N.C., and Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., to help improve Congress’ poor showing when it comes to staff diversity.


	A 2015 study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit think tank that focuses on minority issues, found that African Americans make up less than one percent of top Senate staff despite minorities representing 13 percent of the U.S. population.


	Since the Joint Center study’s release, the number of African American senior Senate staffers has grown from three to seven.


	The Adams-Walker program gives students from North Carolina’s historically black colleges and universities exposure to both political parties by having them split time working for Adams, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Walker, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee.


	A lack of diversity among congressional officers is a problem, Adams and Walker say, because staffers — especially at the senior level — influence senators and House members and play pivotal roles in crafting legislation.


	“You may not understand my community if you don’t live there or you don’t interact there,” Adams said. “The people who go through our program, they are able to teach us a few things, to share information about their schools, about their communities and about the needs.”


	Diversity's progress in Congress remains slow.


	Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., whose special election victory in December in a deep red Southern state was powered by black votes, hired the Senate’s only African American Democratic chief of staff, Dana Gresham.


	Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the Senate’s only African American Republican, also has a black chief of staff, Jennifer DeCasper.


	Brennen Britton, who is black, is Sen. Jerry Moran’s chief of staff. Courtney Temple, an African American woman, is legislative director for Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Darrell Jordan is communications director for Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.


	House Democrats and Republicans provided no data on minority hiring in their congressional offices. House Democrats are conducting a survey on minority hiring as part of a diversity initiative launched by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.


	In December 2016, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., hired Capitol Hill veteran Jonathan Burks as his chief of staff, making him the first African American to hold the position.


	Burks hiring came nearly five months after Ryan posted a selfie with a room full of white Capitol Hill interns behind him.


	That photo, along with a picture earlier this month a mostly-white class of spring 2018 White House interns, crystallizes the diversity issue in Washington, according to Don Bell, director of the Joint Center’s Black Talent Initiative.


	“It speaks to the institutional problem that exists that senior staffers and elected officials themselves who are in charge of hiring and have the opportunity to create opportunities are not being thoughtful enough about how to make sure that they are recruiting qualified people of color from every walk of life,” said Bell, a former president of the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus.


	Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., separately launched Democratic initiatives in the House and the Senate to boost diversity.


	But Congress isn’t subject to some of anti-discrimination and labor laws it has imposed upon the private sector, and there’s little urgency on Capitol Hill for that to change.


	“Part of that is just the fundamental structure on Capitol Hill — every office is essentially its own business,” Bell said. “When you don’t have centralized policies, practices or procedures then you end up with a situation where some offices are much more diverse than others, and many just aren’t because they haven’t been thinking about diversity and inclusion.”


	Meeks, a black caucus member, said Congress should “practice what it preaches” about diversity. He hired Hinton, 23, to be a legislative correspondent and staff assistant after learning about the Adams-Walker internship program.


	“The program was important because it had individuals from HBCUs and it opened doors to Democrats and Republicans, which meant, for me, that there was a likelihood that they would have a well-rounded exposure to how this place works on both sides of the aisle,” Meeks said. “That was important because the position we hired her in, she is really the person who comes into contact first with many of the constituents and others who walk into my office.”


	The internship helped Hinton escape a cycle that keeps many minority applicants from getting full time congressional staffing positions. Most offices require applicants to have prior experience through internships.


	Many African American miss the internship experience because the positions rarely pay enough to allow them to save money and spend a summer in Washington. The Adams-Walker program does.

	“The internship showed me that anything was possible…,” said Hinton, who earned her bachelor’s degree in political science from NC A&T last May. “Since most offices require you have some sort of internship experience, the internship provided me a foot in the door.”


	Now that she’s on Capitol Hill, Hinton wants to stay and move up.


	“I found that there is diversity on the Hill, especially in Democratic offices and the network of minority staffers has certainly helped me along the way,” she said. “Still, when it comes to diversity, Congress, like the rest of America has work to do.”","April 12, 2018","Education and Opportunity","null"

This legislation will provide an improved, nationwide system to help states identify Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients who receive assistance in two or more states - known as ""dual enrollment.""
 
""To make certain SNAP is serving whom it was intended, we have to eliminate fraud and abuse and focus on what works,"" Walker said. ""Through responsible reforms, we can ensure every individual has the opportunity to improve their economic circumstances, escape the cycle of poverty and achieve their full potential.""

SNAP is one of the largest components of the safety net in the U.S. at almost $71 billion in benefits per year. Rolls have exploded in recent years, growing 57 percent since 2008 to more than 44 million participants in 2016, while spending on the program has increased by 89 percent. Since 2001, enrollment in SNAP has grown by 155 percent and spending has increased by 299 percent.


	The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found more than $2 billion in SNAP benefits were paid in error in 2009.


	The SNAP Abuse and Fraud Prevention Act would target wrongful payments by fixing flaws in reporting systems. Currently, the Public Assistance Reporting and Information System (PARIS) is used to detect participants who are dually enrolled. PARIS only identifies a dually enrolled individual within a 3-month period and after the assistance is disbursed.

	 

	This legislation implements the National Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC) nationwide, a program proven to reduce improper payments that occur due to dual participation in SNAP following a 2014 pilot project.


	NAC would result in an estimated savings of $114 million per year and ensures SNAP benefits are properly disbursed, getting to whom it was intended to serve.

	â€œNorth Carolinians have viewed the latest videos of Planned Parenthood in horror as employees are seen haggling over the cost of baby body parts and resuscitating a life only to snuff it out again,â€ said Walker. â€œAfter hearing from hundreds of constituents, one of my top priorities upon returning to Washington was to join my conservative colleagues in this fight.â€


	54% of Americans oppose any taxpayer funding for family planning services performed by organizations that provide abortions.  Meanwhile, despite posting $127 million in excess revenue in 2013, federal tax dollars subsidize Planned Parenthoodâ€™s facilities and staff.

Walker continues to be a champion for the unborn and has joined his colleagues in also calling for investigations into potential criminal activities at Planned Parenthood.  Since the first video was release by the Center for Medical Progress, at least 5 states have moved defund Planned Parenthood in their jurisdiction and 13 have launched investigations.","September 9, 2015","","null"
"1528294531-97","https://walker.house.gov/media-center/press-releases","next ›","https://walker.house.gov/media-center/press-releases?page=6","Walker Introduces the Universal Charitable Giving Act to Incentivize Donations to Charity in Tax Reform","https://walker.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walker-introduces-universal-charitable-giving-act-incentivize-donations","Walker Introduces the Universal Charitable Giving Act to Incentivize Donations to Charity in Tax Reform","WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) introduced a bill that would incentivize charitable giving for low and middle income earning individuals and families.

The Universal Charitable Giving Act establishes an universal charitable deduction for individuals and married couples who do not itemize, in addition to the standard deduction. This would be an above-the-line deduction up to one-third of the standard deduction – about $2,100 for individuals and $4,200 for married couples.


	As reported by The Hill: ""Walker’s bill would allow taxpayers who take the standard deduction to also deduct their charitable contributions up to an amount equal to one-third of the standard deduction. The standard deduction for married couples under current law is $12,700 and would be increased to $24,000 under the GOP’s framework.""

To better explain the importance of the Universal Charitable Giving Act, what it does, and how it helps charities, Walker released a video (above) featuring the Baptist Children's Home of North Carolina. In the video, J. Keith Henry, Chief Operating Officer for Baptist Children's Homes of North Carolina explains that upwards of 65 percent of their budget comes from charitable donations, and that any policy that discourages giving to charity could have a harmful impact on their services. 

A key aspect of the recently released GOP Tax Reform Framework from the White House and Congress is to double the standard deduction so that lower and middle income families keep more of their paycheck and have more income that is not taxed. 


	Under the current tax system around 70 percent of tax filers claim the standard deduction. Estimates have shown, under the new GOP Tax Reform Framework, that number would rise to 95 percent.

	 

	With current law, only taxpayers who itemize their deductions can deduct charitable donations to qualifying organizations. As a potential unintended consequence of the tax plan, the doubling of the standard deduction will lower the number of itemizers and likely decrease charitable giving incentives for many taxpayers.

	 

	The Universal Charitable Giving Act incentivizes charitable giving for low and middle income taxpayers. It would not only help individuals and families who would likely stop itemizing their deductions under the new tax plan, but would also encourage taxpayers who already claim the standard deduction to give the charities and causes they believe in.

	 

	This bill is focused on helping charities, and the lower and middle class. In fiscal year 2017, roughly 71% of the tax expenditures for charitable giving will be claimed by taxpayers who earn $200,000 a year or more. By broadening the base of people who can deduct charitable donations, this bill aims to empower lower and middle income earners to direct funds willingly to socially productive organizations they wish to support.


	You can read the full text of the legislation here. 


	The bill has already garnered attention of prominent organizations such as the Alliance for Charitable Reform, Charitable Giving Coalition and the Independent Sector.

""The Charitable Giving Coalition (CGC) applauds Congressman Mark Walker (R-NC-6) for standing up for America’s charitable organizations and the communities they serve,"" Jason Lee, chair of the Charitable Giving Coalition said. ""Congressman Walker’s bill expands good tax policy, providing an incentive to more Americans to invest in their communities through charitable giving. A non-itemizer deduction will become even more critical within the larger tax reform framework currently under consideration.""","October 12, 2017","Education and Opportunity","null"

	“Good evening.

	 

	“Tonight, you’ve heard how we are working with the new Administration to deliver on our promises and build a safe, strong and proud America. After eight years of the weakest economic growth in a century, we are now  answering back with the strongest legislative record in decades.

	 

	“We have record low unemployment. Companies are bringing back jobs, as well as their revenue that has been kept overseas for far too long.

	 

	“The number is still growing, but already, right now, more than three million Americans have received bonuses in the wake of this new tax reform. Not to mention the 90 percent of Americans starting to see more money in their paychecks just this week.

	 

	“The excitement about our economic strength is not only with Republicans. Democrats and Independents are feeling more positive about the economy than anytime in the past decade. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has paved the way for prosperity and Americans, benefitting all of our communities.

	 

	“This is what happens when Washington listens to the voters and focuses on policies that help everyone, not just a select few.

	 

	“In 2016, voters sent a clear message by casting three million more votes for congressional Republicans than their Democratic counterparts. While we are keeping our promises, we cannot rest on any past accomplishments. There is energy from the left to resist and then resurrect failed policies that benefit only the well-connected in Washington.

	 

	“While we continue to reap the benefits of less government intrusiveness, economic growth, and the progress in protecting life of all ages, it is imperative we keep pushing forward in 2018.

	 

	“I get asked a good bit about the President’s behavior. It would be hypocritical of me to act as if I approve of some of the past actions. Yet, it is also undeniable that our country is soaring back at record levels. The President is blowing gaping holes in the political establishment allowing the legislative branch to seize this opportunity and pass items promised to the American people for decades.

	 

	“Just as the President mentioned tonight, we must keep rebuilding our military and reinstate a peace through strength strategy. We should responsibly invest in our broken infrastructure. And we must insist on fair trade policies that prioritize American businesses.

	 

	“But most importantly, we must keep promoting policies that bring prosperity to people in all of our communities and we must keep communicating our message of why less government overreach in our lives is always better.

	 

	“We should not be satisfied with simply making an argument, but always, each of us, strive to make a difference. May God bless and may we have the courage to follow.”"

This bill allows disabled veterans to contribute to their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account, using their disability compensation.


	In 2015, Congress gave our servicemen and servicewomen a new way to save for retirement by allowing them to contribute money to a TSP.  The TSPs act similar to a 401k, deferring taxes and helping members of the military build a nest egg for the future.


	However, under current law our service members are not able to contribute to their retirement once they transition back to civilian life. This makes saving for the future difficult, especially for the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, 40% of whom are disabled when they come home.

""Our disabled veterans may leave the military, but they never leave service to our country,”Walker said. “Their sacrifice and many of their injuries stay with them. The Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act will allow our heroes to keep contributing to their TSP after they leave the Armed Forces and empower them with a more secure financial future.”


	This retirement provision was based on recommendations from the Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC). It also comes following Walker hosting multiple roundtables with veterans in the community and getting feedback on policy proposals.

“No Governor of North Carolina has the legal authority to submit a Medicaid expansion plan to CMS.  Such actions would commit the state to approximately $600 million in new spending each year.  It is unfortunate that one of Mr. Cooper’s first actions as Governor is to directly go against the same state law and Constitution he swore to uphold.  It is for these reasons that we urge CMS to reject Governor Cooper’s proposal.”

	The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would protect unborn children by preventing abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, at which time scientific evidence suggests the child can feel pain. The legislation includes exceptions for extreme circumstances such as rape, incest, and situations where the life of the mother is seriously threatened. 


	The United States is one of just seven countries in the world that permit abortions after 20 weeks – including human rights violators such as China and North Korea. According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, around 10,000 abortions take place at or after 20 weeks every year.

	On Washington's spending: ""Washington must be more fiscally responsible. It’s not only about elections, it’s about doing what’s best for the next generation.""


	...

""It’s time to bend this bell curve, it can’t happen overnight, I get it, but we must show some true discipline. We have to be the adults in the room. We have funding requests by the billions every single week – Republicans and Democrats – but someone has to step up. Republicans have to step up to be able to bend this back.""


	On the progress towards an omnibus deal: ""Leadership is pulling this as far to the right as possible. They did a great job. Appropriators worked all night to hold the Hyde language, to make sure those pro-life provisions are not affected. The Senate had kind of backed up on that. We appreciate those guys doing that. It’s trending the right direction, but we need more.""


	On entitlement reform: ""A third of the budget is strictly entitlements. We have to take a look at that. And we have to bring a sharp pencil. Social Security won’t even be solvent in the next decade or so if we do not handle some of these items.


	...

""If we don’t deal with [Social Security], it will not exist in twelve years. I am 48. By the time I am 60 it will not exist. More importantly for my children and grandchildren, if we do not have something in place, what kind of legacy is that leaving?""

	Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them.

	 

	Mary Dickerson has been involved with Chatham County 4-H for many years, and has selflessly given her time to serve as a club volunteer leader, advisory council member, and equine educational contest coach. 4-H is an organization that teaches club members life skills through meetings and educational competitions. Ms. Dickerson has been a positive role model and inspiration to countless youth as they learn important skills such as decision-making, problem solving, communication, and teamwork.

“Mary has helped instill confidence in young people, encouraged them to step out of their comfort area to pursue new adventures, and has helped turn young people into true leaders for our community,” Extension Agent Ginger Cunningham said.

	 

	“Mary Dickerson is an excellent example of how one person can make a difference in the lives of young people,” Walker said. “She’s been willing to step in and donate her time, talent and treasure to teach important values and skills. Most of all, Chatham County 4-H participants know that they have a true friend in Mary, and I’m grateful for the positive role model she has been to so many.”

""20.2 trillion. Our national debt is more than $20.2 trillion. Let’s put it this way: each American's share of the national debt is $62,000. From the retiree in Greensboro who has already done so much to serve the country to the newborn child in Burlington with so much potential, $62,000.

	""Is it not a moral injustice to leave this level of debt to the next generation? We’ve been making this argument in the House for years. Today, it’s time to make a difference.""


	Walker voted in favor of the legislation, which would balance the budget over 10 years and offers strong conservative reforms that put the government on path to fiscal responsibility. The budget also paves the way for tax reform by prompting the creation of a budget reconciliation package that can serve as a legislative vehicle for changes in the tax code.

The Taxpayers Before Insurers Act would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to pay the $3.5 billion it has taken from taxpayers back to the U.S. Treasury or face a 50 percent cut in its operating budget.

					 

					To mitigate the high costs of Obamacare's mandates, the bill created three programs, one of which was the Transitional Reinsurance Program. The three-year reinsurance program required the HHS to collect $25 billion from insurers. Of this, the law mandated that HHS send $5 billion directly to the U.S. Treasury to pay down Obamacare's costs on the American people: $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016. The other $20 billion was to be paid back to insurers for covering patients in the exchanges. Despite $4 billion already being due, the Treasury has only received $500 million. Instead, the money required by law to be paid to the Treasury alone is now being sent to well­-connected insurance companies.

					 

					“In Washington, this kind of lawlessness gets overlooked too much. Federal bureaucrats are not above the laws they force upon the American people,” Walker said. “My bill is simple: I want HHS to follow the law it helped write.”

					 

					“This should not be a partisan idea: the government should follow the law and prioritize the people it serves over big insurance companies,” Walker added.

					 

					Representative Walker also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner to explain why he introduced the bill.

					 

					The Taxpayers Before Insurers Act is supported by American for Tax Reform and Citizens Against Government Waste. In a letter to Walker, Grover Norquist, the President of Americans for Tax Reform said “The $3.5 billion in Obamacare reinsurance corporate welfare payments are merely the latest effort by the administration to ignore the law to the benefit of monied special interests.”","July 14, 2016","Accountability","null"

					Each month, Congressman Walker honors a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and making a difference in their community.


					This is the first jointly presented Community Hero of the Month Award for the 6th District.  

					Phil Bowers is the Founder and Executive Director of Sustainable Alamance, a nonprofit organization that takes a unique approach to defining and creating sustainable communities.  The goal of Bowers and his organization is to use bold and innovative methods to connect former offenders facing employment discrimination.  ""I was touched by the personal stories of these men,"" Bowers said.  ""They were ready but just needed help getting access to resources.""  The program has had great success not only providing the mentoring structure and opportunity to develop key interpersonal, life, and work skills, but placing participants with local employers that will provide job opportunities.   


					That is where the Troxler family comes in, filling the second half of the equation.  


					The Troxler brothers, Jesse and Jeremy, along with their father Rockie, have been working in tandem with Mr. Bowers for over five years.  The Troxlers own a local metal works business, Piedmont Metals, and hire individuals from the Sustainable Alamance program who seek to reenter the workforce. Throughout this program partnership, the Troxlers have seen growth for both those employed from the Sustainable Alamance program and for their own business.  


					Bowers and the Troxlers hope they can serve as an example to the community, by offering second chances and by showing that you can create partnerships with people from different backgrounds.  ""We found that there's a tremendous value in the individual, even if they have some skeletons in the closet,"" Jesse Troxler said.  Bowers hopes people can see that ""there is no throw away person. Everybody matters."" 


					“I am so honored to present our first joint Community Hero of the Month Award to two incredibly deserving groups,” Walker said.  “Mr. Bowers and the Troxler family have forged a visionary and key partnership in our community.  This is more than providing an opportunity to people who many would turn away.  This remarkable partnership is a conscious choice to invest in someone’s life and give them a second chance. I look forward to hearing even more success stories as they continue to change lives.”

	""Professor Nicholas Parrillo, who testified before the Committee yesterday, explained, 'There is no comprehensive compilation of guidance, but everyone agrees its volume is oceanic.'

	 

	""While the regulations themselves are often erroneous and harmful, the guidance documents are sporadically posted on agency websites, and the websites of component agencies and various offices. Some are not posted at all. This inconsistency burdens regulated entities, and particularly small businesses, who may not have the resources to hire compliance staff to seek out this information.

	 

	""H.R. 4809 requires transparency and accountability in the regulatory process. The public deserves to have this information. They deserve to know how the agencies administering our laws interpret those laws and regulations. H.R. 4809, with the amendment in the nature of a substitute, requires agencies to post their guidance documents online, in one centralized location.

	 

	""Agencies create these documents and expect the guidance to be followed.  The agencies should therefore have no problem gathering and posting the documents as the bill requires.  In fact, we know that many agencies already have a list – because they have provided it to us. The Committee has been reviewing information about thousands of pieces of agency guidance for several months.

	 

	""At the Committee’s request, federal agencies provided information on more than 12,800 guidance documents issued over the past decade. And that is just a portion of federal guidance documents.  That number is expected to increase as agencies continue to identify guidance and produce information to the Committee.

	 

	""There are a handful of agencies that have been unable to produce a list of guidance documents.  That is a red flag and a clear indication that, at some agencies, guidance documents are not tracked.

	 

	""If an agency doesn’t bother to track the hundreds of guidance documents it issues, how can businesses and taxpayers possibly be expected to comply with them? The burden should be on the agencies to make guidance documents easy to find. 

	 

	""That’s all this bill does—Require agencies to post information they should already have in a centralized location. This is a small step agencies can take that would have significant benefits. Posting these documents in a central location will alleviate burdens on regulated entities and members of the public. It will shine light on this lesser-understood, yet impactful, sector of federal regulatory activity.

	 

	""This legislation is common-sense reform that Members of both parties can support in the name of good governance and transparency. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and the amendment in the nature of a substitute.

	 

	""I yield back."""

""We cannot dig our hands into a hole $20 trillion deep to bail out insurance companies. Even worse, we will be adding insult to injury by masking the failures of Obamacare at the expense of hardworking taxpayers. The people of North Carolina are already paying enough because of Obamacare’s pitfalls. Instead of the executive branch issuing unconstitutional payments to bail out insurance companies, the Senate should continue working until they have passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Their constituents are tired of their inability to fulfill their promise.""

The CSR payments are illegal because Congress, who holds the constitutional power of the purse, never authorized the payments. They are the center of a 2014 lawsuit where House Republicans sued the Obama administration on the constitutionality of the payments directly to insurance companies, practically serving as a bail out. A Federal District Court judge agreed and ordered the payments had to be halted.

According to The New York Times: 

""Congress never provided explicit authority for the spending, she ruled. 'Such an appropriation cannot be inferred,' the judge said in her opinion. She blocked further spending under the program but said that order would be suspended pending an appeal by the Obama administration.""

In April, the Trump administration announced it would temporarily continue CSR payments. Following that decision Walker said that ""The Constitution provides that ‘No money may be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of Appropriations made by Law.’  

""Congress has made no appropriation for Obamacare cost sharing reduction payments,""Walker added. ""Therefore, we believe making these payments without congressional approval is both clearly illegal and unconstitutional, as the district court held in House v. Price.""","August 16, 2017","Spending Cuts and Debt","null"

Walker Names Rick Morton of Greensboro Community Hero of the Month","GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today honored Rick Morton of Greensboro as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for September 2016.

Each month, Congressman Walker honors a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in their community.

Mr. Morton works at Heads Up Barber and Beauty in Greensboro, but behind the barber chair, he has been providing free haircuts and so much more to our community’s young people for the past 2 years through his organization, “Heads up For Our Youth.”

Inspired by a friend who volunteered at a local middle school, Mr. Morton decided to donate his time and talents by providing haircuts to well deserving youth in the community.  He quickly saw how this simple gesture could make young people feel more confident, and in turn, do better in school.

If there is one thing Rick wants people to know about the work that the organization does, it’s that it’s bigger than one person.  He credits the talented team of barbers he works with who are consistently planning events and showing up to serve youth and help them thrive. 

The program provides transportation, a haircut, lunch, and lessons on grooming and presenting themselves professionally, at no cost to the youth.  The organization has now expanded to three different initiatives, offering a financial literacy course and a basketball clinic as well. 

“I am honored to have the opportunity to recognize Rick Morton as a leader in our community and a positive role model for our youth,” Walker said.  “He is the perfect example of how someone can provide a simple service to a young person and actually change the trajectory of their life. Because of Mr. Morton’s willingness to use his time to help others, these youth are not only better poised to succeed at school, but also better poised to succeed in all of life’s ventures.”

Walker presented Morton with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol during a visit to Heads Up Barber and Beauty.","September 2, 2016","","null"

A preserved record is any record maintained by a person other than the federal government pursuant to a rule, guidance, or other directive from the IRS recommending or requiring that the person maintain records for a particular period of time.

""The bureaucratic failures of the IRS were on full display yesterday as they were unable to perform even a basic duty on their most critical day of the year,"" Walker said. ""Another way the IRS is failing North Carolina taxpayers is with lack of accountability. Run for almost a decade by Commissioners who spent more time misleading Congress and attempting to bury scandals than they did serving Americans, the IRS has operated under a different set of rules than what they expect from taxpayers. The Ditto Act forces accountability on the IRS and ensures that they are working under the same rules as the people and businesses of North Carolina.""

He was recently presented the Trooper D.R. Bowick Trooper of the Year Award from his peers at the NCSHP.

	 
“Trooper Mitchell optimizes what is means to be a NCSHP Trooper,” the NCSHP said. “His commitment to family, his work ethic, and community involvement through his church, local sports teams, and fundraising with the NCSHP basketball team are to be commended.

This legislation will provide an improved, nationwide system to help states identify Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients who receive assistance in two or more states - known as ""dual enrollment.""
 
""To make certain SNAP is serving whom it was intended, we have to eliminate fraud and abuse and focus on what works,"" Walker said. ""Through responsible reforms, we can ensure every individual has the opportunity to improve their economic circumstances, escape the cycle of poverty and achieve their full potential.""

SNAP is one of the largest components of the safety net in the U.S. at almost $71 billion in benefits per year. Rolls have exploded in recent years, growing 57 percent since 2008 to more than 44 million participants in 2016, while spending on the program has increased by 89 percent. Since 2001, enrollment in SNAP has grown by 155 percent and spending has increased by 299 percent.


	The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found more than $2 billion in SNAP benefits were paid in error in 2009.


	The SNAP Abuse and Fraud Prevention Act would target wrongful payments by fixing flaws in reporting systems. Currently, the Public Assistance Reporting and Information System (PARIS) is used to detect participants who are dually enrolled. PARIS only identifies a dually enrolled individual within a 3-month period and after the assistance is disbursed.

	 

	This legislation implements the National Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC) nationwide, a program proven to reduce improper payments that occur due to dual participation in SNAP following a 2014 pilot project.


	NAC would result in an estimated savings of $114 million per year and ensures SNAP benefits are properly disbursed, getting to whom it was intended to serve.

Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them.

	 

	As a volunteer with the Alamance County YMCA, Pardue saw the YMCA as a popular spot for students after school. He also witnessed the food insecurity many students faced outside of school. Pardue collaborated with both ABSS and the YMCA to build a shelter at the Alamance County YMCA where meals could be provided to students through ABSS. Pardue helped raise $90,000 in donations to build the shelter.

	 

	“Alex saw a need in our community and instead of convincing himself of why it couldn’t be done, he sprung to action, collaborating with others to find a solution that will result in 100,000 meals being provided to hungry students each year,” Walker said. “Heroism isn’t about age, it’s about a heart of service and a willingness to put yourself before others. Alex embodies this spirit and the idea that age and capacity do not exempt anyone from the call to make a difference.”

	 

	 “The YMCA is committed to strengthening our community through collaborations and partnerships, providing resources needed to achieve greater health and well-being for all,” Britt said. “Feeding hungry children is a great opportunity to assist in the strengthening of Alamance County.  Alex’s commitment to this project has been integral in our cause and we are truly blessed by all of his efforts to serve others.”","April 5, 2018","","null"

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives with a 227-203 vote.

""Here is what this historic vote means: At the beginning of next year, the hardworking families of North Carolina will finally see more money in their pockets,"" Walker said. “With this critical promise kept, we can proclaim that “the worker deserves his wages,” and that middle income families – not the government – are best equipped to make their own financial decisions. The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act helps us turn on the engines of economic growth in our communities, stop the government from overtaxing North Carolinians to prop up failed economic policies, and frees people from Obamacare’s erroneous individual mandate tax that punishes lower and middle income families for not buying health insurance they don’t want or cannot afford.""


	The legislation is expected to be taken up and approved by the Senate on the evening of Tuesday, December 19th, and then sent to the President's desk to be signed into law.

	Dear Administrator Long,


	As Members of Congress representing the people of North Carolina, we write in support of Governor Roy Cooper’s request that the President declare of a major disaster for the State of North Carolina, under Section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act, as a result of severe weather that effected Guilford and Rockingham counties on April 15, 2018.


	Since the storms impacted the area state, county, and FEMA officials have undertaken preliminary damage assessments (PDA) for Individual Assistance (IA). The findings of these assessments underscore the devastation that was brought upon these communities by the EF2 tornado. In Guilford County the PDA found the 36 homes or businesses were destroyed, 180 homes suffered major damage, 289 homes have minor damage, and 316 properties affected. Further three elementary schools in Guilford County will remain closed for the remainder of the school year due to damage inflicted on the buildings. In Rockingham County the PDA found five homes or businesses destroyed, seven with major damages, 21 with minor damages, and 19 properties affected.


	While any family or business adversely affected by severe weather is a tragedy, the storm on April 15, 2018 hit areas with poverty rates over 3.5% above the national average. This will make recovering and putting people’s lives together even more difficult. Too that end, we urge the President to approve this request for a major disaster declaration, consistent with the intended purposes of FEMA and the federal Stafford Act, that will provide Individual Assistance as soon as possible to assist the citizens of these two counties.


	We would like to thank you for FEMA’s efforts in recent years as our state continues to recover from Hurricane Matthew, and look forward to working collaboratively with FEMA, state agencies, and county officials as we begin to rebuild from this most recent storm.","April 28, 2018","","null"

This legislation would increase government accountability and transparency, while lessening the burden on small businesses by requiring federal agencies to post regulatory guidance documents online in an easy to find location. The bill is a House companion to S.2296, introduced by U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).
 
To circumvent responsibility and the legal rule-making process, the previous Administration had federal agencies issue ""guidance"" to serve as de facto regulations.


	""The Obama Administration made an art of evading public scrutiny by replacing formal rule-making with a stream of 'guidance,' 'bulletins' and 'statements of policy,'"" The Wall Street Journal wrote.


	While the regulations themselves were often erroneous and harmful to businesses, they also created undue burden in compliance as the guidance took on many different forms – blog posts, memos, letters, and news releases.


	The GOOD Act would bring clarity to the process by forcing all federal agencies to publish guidance documents on their website.

""Our out-of-control regulatory system represents roughly $2 trillion in cost on the economy and American small businesses every single year,"" Walker said. ""Worse yet, federal agencies are going around the rule-process to avoid accountability and oversight. If agencies expect the small businesses of North Carolina to comply with their burdensome rules, they should at a minimum make the information available and easily accessible.""

“In addition to facing onerous federal regulations, American businesses are also expected to follow regulatory guidance issued by agencies,"" Johnson said. ""Yet, unlike the public rule-making process for regulations, federal agencies are not required to disseminate guidance broadly to the public for input, making it hard for businesses and industry groups to monitor and follow. This bill will lift the veil of secrecy by requiring federal agencies to post regulatory guidance documents in a centralized location on their websites. This common sense bill would provide much needed transparency to American businesses and consumers.”

The GOOD Act has received praise from Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). ""Requiring vastly more disclosure, ensuring that federal agencies post all guidance documents online is a sensible and essential step to beginning to hold federal agencies accountable for their actions,"" Clyde Wane Crews, vice president for policy at CEI said.

As Hazel and Sorjonen write, ""a tax system with a 20 percent corporate tax rate and a modern territorial tax system will boost economic growth here at home and level the playing field for U.S. businesses and workers — including P&G’s U.S. employees here in Greensboro.""

Read the op-ed in its entirety here and below:

Congress is in the midst of moving a tax bill that is essential to the United States’ economic future. Allow us an opportunity to introduce some facts on why it is so important to our company, our workers and our community.


	Procter & Gamble sells consumer products in more than 180 countries and territories. We have 25 manufacturing sites located in 19 U.S. states and territories, as well as nearly 90 manufacturing sites in foreign countries, where we manufacture products close to the consumers we serve worldwide.


	Here in Greensboro, we proudly employ nearly 1,200 people between two manufacturing facilities. Within North Carolina, P&G purchases about $995 million of products and services from more than 495 suppliers.


	At P&G, we believe tax reform is crucial for both our company and our country. Why? The U.S. tax system puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. P&G has been a global company for more than 100 of our 180 years. In fact, one in five of P&G’s U.S.-based jobs support our international business, in areas such as manufacturing, marketing, innovation and supply chain management.


	So, when P&G succeeds in international markets, it means we succeed here at home, too.


	However, the U.S. corporate tax rate is among the highest in the developed world at 35 percent. The current global average for developed countries is about 24 percent, and countries are lowering their rates further, creating a downward trend. This makes it harder for P&G and other U.S.-headquartered businesses — small and large — to compete with peer companies headquartered overseas. It also reduces the competitiveness of the U.S. economy as a place to do business and create jobs. The Congress is currently considering legislation that would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.


	Congress is also considering legislation that would move the U.S. tax code from a worldwide corporate income tax system to what is known as a territorial tax system. This would help American companies, including P&G, compete on a level playing field. Unlike P&G, our competitors headquartered outside the United States — who already operate under a territorial system — do not pay additional tax to their home countries when they sell products outside their home countries. Because 60 percent of P&G’s sales are global, the current U.S. tax code puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Other American companies are in a similar position.


	As members of Congress debate whether or not to pass tax reform in the coming weeks, it is important to remember that economic growth and jobs in our community depend on having a competitive U.S. tax system. The details will matter, but a tax system with a 20 percent corporate tax rate and a modern territorial tax system will boost economic growth here at home and level the playing field for U.S. businesses and workers — including P&G’s U.S. employees here in Greensboro.","December 11, 2017","Jobs and Economic Growth","null"

“Local banks used to serve as the epicenter of growth for our community, proudly thriving on Main Streets in our towns and serving as the source of capital for local businesses to start, expand, and grow. Unfortunately, heavy-handed and costly regulations in the Dodd-Frank legislation have caused many of these small banks to shutter or pass along financial burdens to consumers and job creators. Last year, the House proudly passed the Financial CHOICE Act to reverse course, but the Senate ultimately failed to pass it. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act includes many of those same reforms and focuses on freeing our local banks to help our communities thrive.”


	On June 8, 2017, the House passed H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017.


	This legislation would modify provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act) and other laws governing regulation of the financial industry. The bill would change the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets under $10 billion (community banks) and for large banks with assets over $50 billion. The bill also would make changes to consumer mortgage and credit-reporting regulations and to the authorities of the agencies that regulate the financial industry.


	In 2010 (the year the Dodd–Frank Act was signed into law), North Carolina's 6th District's housed nine community banks including CommunityOne Bank in Asheboro, NewBridge Bank in Greensboro, and Mid-Carolina Bank in Burlington. Today, that number is only two as Dodd-Frank regulations have forced closures and mergers across North Carolina. In fact, community banks are closing at a national rate of one per day. Meanwhile, the five largest banks in the country have grown their domestic assets by more than 40 percent during the same time. 


	Instead of fixing the causes at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, the 2,300-plus page Dodd-Frank bill codified into law “too big to fail” and taxpayer-funded bailouts. And instead of being tough on Wall Street, it put many local banks out of business because they did not have the resources to navigate the expansive and costly regulations. The effect has been seen in communities nationwide.  


	Small, community banks account for 54 percent of small business loans across the country. Small businesses make up 64 percent of net new private sector jobs.

The letter was sent following  the Supreme Court decision to hear International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump in October.

The letter states, in part: 


	“As an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, you are required to recuse yourself in cases in which your “impartiality might reasonably be questioned,”  and where you have “a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rested its decision in International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump on President Trump's campaign statements. The case places the personal credibility of President Trump directly at issue. Given your repeated public criticism of both candidates and President Trump, the statue is triggered and your recusal in Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project is required by law.


	""Your public criticism of Donald Trump during the campaign included statements such as, ""I can't imagine what this place would be–I can't imagine what the country would be–with Donald Trump as our president."" You referred to Donald Trump as ""a faker."" When asked about the possibility of Donald Trump winning the presidency, you responded, ""I don't want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs.""


	""Additionally, friendly media outlets harshly criticized your conduct. For example, the editorial board of The New York Times found it ""baffling that Justice Ginsburg would choose to...call her own commitment to impartiality into question,"" and wondered whether, in a case involving Mr. Trump, if anyone could ""now argue with a straight face that Justice Ginsburg's only guide would be the law.""


	""You are bound by law to recuse yourself from participation in this case. There is no doubt that your impartiality can be reasonably questioned; indeed, it would be unreasonable not to question your impartiality. Failure to recuse yourself from any such case would violate the law and undermine the credibility of the Supreme Court of the United States.”

	“Good evening.

	 

	“Tonight, you’ve heard how we are working with the new Administration to deliver on our promises and build a safe, strong and proud America. After eight years of the weakest economic growth in a century, we are now  answering back with the strongest legislative record in decades.

	 

	“We have record low unemployment. Companies are bringing back jobs, as well as their revenue that has been kept overseas for far too long.

	 

	“The number is still growing, but already, right now, more than three million Americans have received bonuses in the wake of this new tax reform. Not to mention the 90 percent of Americans starting to see more money in their paychecks just this week.

	 

	“The excitement about our economic strength is not only with Republicans. Democrats and Independents are feeling more positive about the economy than anytime in the past decade. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has paved the way for prosperity and Americans, benefitting all of our communities.

	 

	“This is what happens when Washington listens to the voters and focuses on policies that help everyone, not just a select few.

	 

	“In 2016, voters sent a clear message by casting three million more votes for congressional Republicans than their Democratic counterparts. While we are keeping our promises, we cannot rest on any past accomplishments. There is energy from the left to resist and then resurrect failed policies that benefit only the well-connected in Washington.

	 

	“While we continue to reap the benefits of less government intrusiveness, economic growth, and the progress in protecting life of all ages, it is imperative we keep pushing forward in 2018.

	 

	“I get asked a good bit about the President’s behavior. It would be hypocritical of me to act as if I approve of some of the past actions. Yet, it is also undeniable that our country is soaring back at record levels. The President is blowing gaping holes in the political establishment allowing the legislative branch to seize this opportunity and pass items promised to the American people for decades.

	 

	“Just as the President mentioned tonight, we must keep rebuilding our military and reinstate a peace through strength strategy. We should responsibly invest in our broken infrastructure. And we must insist on fair trade policies that prioritize American businesses.

	 

	“But most importantly, we must keep promoting policies that bring prosperity to people in all of our communities and we must keep communicating our message of why less government overreach in our lives is always better.

	 

	“We should not be satisfied with simply making an argument, but always, each of us, strive to make a difference. May God bless and may we have the courage to follow.”"

“I am thankful the President has taken this important step in empowering federal agencies to refocus their efforts towards combatting the opioid crisis. Congress has passed laws that provide resources to confront this epidemic, but as we learned last week in our Opioid Crisis Tour throughout North Carolina, more action is clearly needed. We will remain committed to working with local law enforcement, first responders, and local government to stop the overwhelming hardship this is causing to the families of our community.”

According to Roll Call, ""the declaration would direct all federal agencies to make the crisis their number one priority. It would include awareness and prevention programs and allow the federal government to work with states to redistribute already-available grants that support substance abuse efforts.""


	Last week, Walker hosted a two-day, seven-stop opioid crisis tour across North Carolina to better understand the full scope of the opioid epidemic and to get a firsthand account of the realities, burdens, and struggles of opioid addiction in North Carolina. Read more about the Opioid Crisis Tour in a story in the Washington Examiner here. 

As the story notes, ""since 1999, opioid-related deaths in North Carolina have increased by 800 percent, nationwide drug overdoses now kill more Americans than gun homicides and car crashes combined.""


	In 2016, more than two million Americans had an addiction to prescription or illicit opioids. Since 2000, over 300,000 Americans have died from overdoses involving opioids.

""The most impressive, and the most popular alternative health care legislation, both in the 113th and the 114th Congress, is Dr. Phil Roe’s American Health Care Reform Act,"" Walker said. ""Dr. Phil Roe is uniquely qualified to lead our efforts to restore sanity to health care, and change the focus of our system away from bureaucratic mandates to compassionate care for patients by trusted doctors – paid for in a responsible way.""

Walker also spoke on the broken promises and damages Obamacare has caused.

This legislation would save taxpayer money and bring needed accountability to federal agencies by requiring them to report on the status of Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (IG) recommendations in their annual budget justification. The GAO-IG Act is a House companion bill to S.2276, introduced by U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

These changes represent potential savings of at least $87 billion for taxpayers as agencies will be forced to improve based on IG and GAO recommendations or will be required to provide justification for not implementing the recommendations.


	As of 2016, there were more than 15,000 open and unimplemented federal agency recommendations from the IG and more than 8,000 open GAO federal agency recommendations.

“Right now, North Carolina taxpayers are having their hard-earned money wasted by federal bureaucrats who have been told how to improve and become more efficient, but refuse to follow recommendations,” Walker said. “That is unacceptable. This bipartisan legislation will make government better, more accountable, and save taxpayer dollars.”

“This bipartisan bill will help make our federal government more accountable and save taxpayer dollars - two things Hoosiers want,” said Senator Young. “Ensuring Congress has the information necessary to conduct effective oversight will lead to increased transparency for federal agencies and better service to taxpayers.” 

“I’m glad to partner with Senator Young on a bill that gives Congress a powerful tool to hold agencies accountable and make sure they are working on behalf of American families,” said Senator Warren. “This bipartisan bill will make our government more transparent and effective – and save taxpayers real money.”

	“When I talk to the people of North Carolina, a common sentiment I hear is the American Dream is fading,"" Walker said. ""This concern becomes reality driving on Front St. in Burlington or Steele St. in Sanford, observing the vanished local banks that used to serve as the epicenter of growth for our community. Burdening regulations have diminished the backbone of our local economy and the true cost can only be measured in small businesses not started, workers not hired and dreams not filled. With our vote on the Financial CHOICE Act, we can start to reverse course and upend the country’s historically slow economic recovery, while placing the stiffest penalties in history on Wall Street abuse.”


	In 2010 (the year the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law), North Carolina's 6th District's housed nine community banks including CommunityOne Bank in Asheboro, NewBridge Bank in Greensboro, and Mid-Carolina Bank in Burlington. Today, that number is only two as Dodd-Frank regulations have forced closures and mergers across North Carolina. In fact, community banks are closing at a national rate of one per day. Meanwhile, the five largest banks in the country have grown their domestic assets by more than 40 percent during the same time. 


	Instead of fixing the causes at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, the 2,300-plus page Dodd-Frank bill codified into law “too big to fail” and taxpayer-funded bailouts. And instead of being tough on Wall Street, it put many local banks out of business because they did not have the resources to navigate the expansive and costly regulations. The effect has been seen in communities nationwide.  


	Dodd-Frank has also been noted as a major cause of our ongoing economic recovery – which is the slowest and weakest in 70 years. 

The Financial CHOICE Act reins in Dodd-Frank and gives local banks and small businesses an opportunity for success. The bill would protect taxpayers from paying for more Wall Street bailouts, forcing failing banks and financial institutions to go through bankruptcy like any other company.


	The Financial CHOICE Act also holds Wall Street accountable by imposing the toughest penalties for financial fraud in history. Additionally, the bill cuts the deficit by $33.6 billion over 10 years. 


	Small, community banks account for 54 percent of small business loans across the country. Small businesses make up 64 percent of net new private sector jobs.  By empowering community banks, the Financial CHOICE Act will help grow jobs and the economy in North Carolina.","June 8, 2017","Jobs and Economic Growth","null"

	“Good evening.

	 

	“Tonight, you’ve heard how we are working with the new Administration to deliver on our promises and build a safe, strong and proud America. After eight years of the weakest economic growth in a century, we are now  answering back with the strongest legislative record in decades.

	 

	“We have record low unemployment. Companies are bringing back jobs, as well as their revenue that has been kept overseas for far too long.

	 

	“The number is still growing, but already, right now, more than three million Americans have received bonuses in the wake of this new tax reform. Not to mention the 90 percent of Americans starting to see more money in their paychecks just this week.

	 

	“The excitement about our economic strength is not only with Republicans. Democrats and Independents are feeling more positive about the economy than anytime in the past decade. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has paved the way for prosperity and Americans, benefitting all of our communities.

	 

	“This is what happens when Washington listens to the voters and focuses on policies that help everyone, not just a select few.

	 

	“In 2016, voters sent a clear message by casting three million more votes for congressional Republicans than their Democratic counterparts. While we are keeping our promises, we cannot rest on any past accomplishments. There is energy from the left to resist and then resurrect failed policies that benefit only the well-connected in Washington.

	 

	“While we continue to reap the benefits of less government intrusiveness, economic growth, and the progress in protecting life of all ages, it is imperative we keep pushing forward in 2018.

	 

	“I get asked a good bit about the President’s behavior. It would be hypocritical of me to act as if I approve of some of the past actions. Yet, it is also undeniable that our country is soaring back at record levels. The President is blowing gaping holes in the political establishment allowing the legislative branch to seize this opportunity and pass items promised to the American people for decades.

	 

	“Just as the President mentioned tonight, we must keep rebuilding our military and reinstate a peace through strength strategy. We should responsibly invest in our broken infrastructure. And we must insist on fair trade policies that prioritize American businesses.

	 

	“But most importantly, we must keep promoting policies that bring prosperity to people in all of our communities and we must keep communicating our message of why less government overreach in our lives is always better.

	 

	“We should not be satisfied with simply making an argument, but always, each of us, strive to make a difference. May God bless and may we have the courage to follow.”"

The following is an excerpt of the statements made by Congressman Walker:  


	“As this Administration has done time and time again, they attacked someone who refused to enforce their political agenda. This time it was different though. When you attack our community, we fight back. And here, we not only fought, but we won.


	“The Department of Justice came in and froze money, blocked necessary grants, and caused funds that needed to be spent on Alamance County and the protection of the people to be spent on defending this needless lawsuit. This money should have been spent investing in jobs or building schools and providing better education and opportunity to our students. Instead it went to defending our community from political attacks, placing the deputies and the citizens of Alamance County at risk in the process.


	“I am proud of the work my office did to force the Justice Department to free up frozen Alamance County funds and right some of the wrongs that occurred here. It is my hope now that Sheriff Johnson and his department can move forward and continue protecting the citizens of Alamance County.”


	Sheriff Terry Johnson also spoke of Congressman Walker’s support saying, “This man…he stood up for this agency in Washington, D.C. to get federal drug asset forfeiture money released to us. $351,000 that we needed tremendously to buy equipment to protect our citizens in this county.

Randy Forbes Announce Walker as New Co-chair of Congressional Prayer Caucus","https://walker.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/senator-james-lankford-former-rep-randy-forbes-announce-walker-new-co","Senator James Lankford, Former Rep. Randy Forbes Announce Walker as New Co-chair of Congressional Prayer Caucus","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressional Prayer Caucus co-chairman Senator James Lankford (R-OK) and former Rep. Randy Forbes (R-VA) today announced that Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC) will serve as the new House co-chair of the Caucus. Walker will assume the leadership role previously held by Forbes, who founded the Caucus in 2005 to protect the right of individuals to pray and practice their faith freely. You can read more about the Caucus here. 

	 
""Our nation was founded on the solid conviction that all men were endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, yet across America, faith has come under attack,” said Forbes. “Freedom of conscience is part of who we are as a nation, and we must preserve this fundamental freedom in our nation. That's why I founded the Prayer Caucus. Today, the strength and size of the Caucus is a testament to the importance of protecting and preserving our nation's Judeo-Christian heritage. I look forward to not only seeing the Caucus grow, but to continue its work to preserve the presence of religion, faith, and morality in the marketplace of ideas.""

	 
“I am extremely grateful for Rep. Randy Forbes and his leadership of the Congressional Prayer Caucus over the last decade,” said Lankford. “America is stronger because of his commitment to creating this Caucus, and being a consistent champion for religious freedom. Our nation is a diverse country that values the freedom to have faith or have no faith at all. It is vitally important that Congress respects these values in public policy, as well as culture. The Congressional Prayer Caucus has worked successfully to advocate for and protect values that are fundamental to the fabric of our nation, and I’m honored to have Rep. Mark Walker serve as co-chairman.”

	 
""I am honored to serve as Co-chair of the Congressional Prayer Caucus with my good friend Senator Lankford,” said Walker. “Prayer is a source of strength and hope for so many Americans – a source we must recognize and protect. Though politics can be divisive at times, prayer should be a uniting force for Congress and for our nation. I look forward to serving the caucus and fighting to protect one of the foundations of our First Amendment.”

	 

	In January 2015, Lankford became the first senator to join the Caucus since its founding in 2005, making the Caucus bicameral. Lankford first joined the Caucus after his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010. Before 2010, Senator Lankford served in full-time ministry for 22 years. Most recently, he was the Director of Student Ministry at the Baptist Convention of Oklahoma and Director of the Falls Creek Youth Camp, the largest youth camp in the United States.

	 

	The Congressional Prayer Caucus recognizes the vital role that prayer by individuals of all faiths has played in uniting Americans as a people, and in making us a more generous, more cooperative, and more forgiving people than we might otherwise have been. The Congressional Prayer Caucus has also served to successfully promote efforts that protect the free exercise of religion for all Americans, no matter what faith tradition they observe. 

	 

	During the 114th Congress, the Congressional Prayer Caucus maintained a bipartisan, bicameral group of more than 90 Members, and the Caucus has experienced many successes since its founding in 2005. The Caucus advocated for a change in military regulations governing religious expression; passed legislation reaffirming 'In God We Trust' as our national motto; defended the practice of legislative prayer; and advocated for the reversal of the policy at Walter Reed Medical Center that prohibited individuals from using or distributing religious items during visits to the hospital. The Caucus has also defended the right of religious student groups to operate on secular campuses according to their faith; urged the Administration to protect religious hiring rights; supported legislation to ensure that all child welfare service providers have the equal opportunity to serve children and families; and worked to ensure that our national motto and Pledge of Allegiance were included in the US Capitol Visitor Center. 

	 

	In 2017, the Caucus will continue advocating for the free exercise of religion for people of all faiths.","January 9, 2017","","null"

Congress Must Act to Fix Our Broken Criminal Justice System
The Hill

	By: Reps. Mark Walker and Cedric Richmond

	April 13, 2018

Our criminal justice system is crumbling. Over the last 40 years, our domestic incarceration rate has quadrupled, creating a crisis of more than 2 million people behind bars in the United States today. Simultaneously, recidivism rates have grown or remained high across almost every identifiable demographic or cross section. And yet, crime rates have steadily fallen.


	This paradox exposes a simple fact: our criminal justice system is in desperate need of reform. What’s more, almost everyone in Congress knows it. Passing significant reforms to our criminal justice system could bring relief to families and communities in every state, district and territory.


	Over the past few weeks, at our respective retreats, members of Congress from both parties discussed our priorities. We believe criminal justice reform needs to be on the top of that list.


	Since arriving in Congress, we have seen increasing awareness, education, energy and interest in criminal justice reform, but, to date, we have not been able to enact necessary changes. Senators have formed working groups. The House Judiciary Committee passed strong, bipartisan legislation out of committee last year. But no tangible results. That has to change.


	Together, we are calling on congressional leadership – of both parties – to dedicate the resources and afford this issue the national attention it deserves. As Dr. King taught us, the time is always right to do what is right.


	While there will undoubtedly be policy disagreements and grandstanding from those vested in the status quo or more interested in their immediate political future than the welfare of their constituents, the reality is inescapable. 


	Incarceration statistics paint a grim picture of the nightmare millions face: 2.7 million children under the age of 18 have an incarcerated parent; there are more jails than colleges in the United States; non-violent drug offenses account for almost half of the total population in federal prisons; and taxpayers spend more than $70 billion each year to incarcerate 1 in 100 American adults. Even worse, these wasted dollars make us all less safe. We have the opportunity to restore families and help people find redemption instead of condemnation.


	Like a house in decay from decades of neglect, our criminal justice system requires repair. We have tried small fixes, but our piecemeal approach has not been enough.


	While legislation will not solve all these problems, it could make a meaningful dent. Passing criminal justice reform legislation stands to make an immediate impact on millions of Americans – restoring families, rebuilding lives and revitalizing communities.


	Our conversations about criminal justice reform should reach beyond crime and punishment. We have to focus on restoration and rehabilitation. We have to rebuild the relationships between police and the communities they serve. Children should not bear the consequences of the actions of their mothers and fathers, nor should we leave them trapped in a cycle of crime and poverty. Moreover, crime should have a cost, but, once paid, society should help lay a path to success for those who have paid their debt.


	We have seen the rising opioid epidemic correctly identified as a public health crisis. Congress has the opportunity to respond differently now than it did to the crack epidemic that wrecked black communities in the ’80s and made our criminal justice system what it is today. Congress has a responsibility to take action when we see a threat to any of our communities. Our current criminal justice system is a threat to all communities because it shackles people to a life of struggle while making us all less safe.


	We must take a holistic approach to reform. From prevention to rehabilitation, Congress has the unique opportunity to address each aspect of our broken system.


	Teaching marketable job skills, treating mental health needs and substance abuse, providing educational opportunities, building social and team skills, and strengthening our halfway houses are all demonstrable ways of reducing recidivism and personal patterns of crime.  Something as simple as helping inmates get a government ID card prior to release can have a positive impact on a person’s post-incarceration potential.


	There is a broad coalition, both on and off the Hill, supporting bipartisan action. Congress should act and we are ready to help lead the way.


	This is the right time to move the discussion on criminal justice reform forward and rebuild our broken system.

“This legislation will remove harmful and useless penalties that punish manufacturers for hiring and investing in our communities. We have worked hard to deliver on this reform that will lead to millions of dollars being reinvested in North Carolina as we continue to lead the nation in manufacturing and economic growth. It is my hope that my colleagues will move quickly to send this bipartisan bill to the President’s desk.”


	This bill is the result of efforts by Walker and Members of the House Ways and Means Committee in the 114th Congress on H.R. 4923, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act – legislation that revived and reformed a process for American businesses to apply for a suspension of harmful tariffs on materials that are needed, but not made in the United States.


	Part of that process is for businesses to petition the independent, non-partisan International Trade Commission (ITC), and following review and rejection based on any request that would impact a U.S. producer, the ITC reports the petitions to Congress for consideration as legislation. The collection of those petitions is the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018.


	“[Walker] was the champion for this,” Leib Oehmig, President and Chief Operating Officer of Glen Raven Inc. in Glen Raven, N.C., said. (See Oehmig’s full testimony to Congress in a 2016 hearing here.)

The letter was sent following  the Supreme Court decision to hear International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump in October.

The letter states, in part: 


	“As an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, you are required to recuse yourself in cases in which your “impartiality might reasonably be questioned,”  and where you have “a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rested its decision in International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump on President Trump's campaign statements. The case places the personal credibility of President Trump directly at issue. Given your repeated public criticism of both candidates and President Trump, the statue is triggered and your recusal in Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project is required by law.


	""Your public criticism of Donald Trump during the campaign included statements such as, ""I can't imagine what this place would be–I can't imagine what the country would be–with Donald Trump as our president."" You referred to Donald Trump as ""a faker."" When asked about the possibility of Donald Trump winning the presidency, you responded, ""I don't want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs.""


	""Additionally, friendly media outlets harshly criticized your conduct. For example, the editorial board of The New York Times found it ""baffling that Justice Ginsburg would choose to...call her own commitment to impartiality into question,"" and wondered whether, in a case involving Mr. Trump, if anyone could ""now argue with a straight face that Justice Ginsburg's only guide would be the law.""


	""You are bound by law to recuse yourself from participation in this case. There is no doubt that your impartiality can be reasonably questioned; indeed, it would be unreasonable not to question your impartiality. Failure to recuse yourself from any such case would violate the law and undermine the credibility of the Supreme Court of the United States.”

	“When I talk to the people of North Carolina, a common sentiment I hear is the American Dream is fading,"" Walker said. ""This concern becomes reality driving on Front St. in Burlington or Steele St. in Sanford, observing the vanished local banks that used to serve as the epicenter of growth for our community. Burdening regulations have diminished the backbone of our local economy and the true cost can only be measured in small businesses not started, workers not hired and dreams not filled. With our vote on the Financial CHOICE Act, we can start to reverse course and upend the country’s historically slow economic recovery, while placing the stiffest penalties in history on Wall Street abuse.”


	In 2010 (the year the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law), North Carolina's 6th District's housed nine community banks including CommunityOne Bank in Asheboro, NewBridge Bank in Greensboro, and Mid-Carolina Bank in Burlington. Today, that number is only two as Dodd-Frank regulations have forced closures and mergers across North Carolina. In fact, community banks are closing at a national rate of one per day. Meanwhile, the five largest banks in the country have grown their domestic assets by more than 40 percent during the same time. 


	Instead of fixing the causes at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, the 2,300-plus page Dodd-Frank bill codified into law “too big to fail” and taxpayer-funded bailouts. And instead of being tough on Wall Street, it put many local banks out of business because they did not have the resources to navigate the expansive and costly regulations. The effect has been seen in communities nationwide.  


	Dodd-Frank has also been noted as a major cause of our ongoing economic recovery – which is the slowest and weakest in 70 years. 

The Financial CHOICE Act reins in Dodd-Frank and gives local banks and small businesses an opportunity for success. The bill would protect taxpayers from paying for more Wall Street bailouts, forcing failing banks and financial institutions to go through bankruptcy like any other company.


	The Financial CHOICE Act also holds Wall Street accountable by imposing the toughest penalties for financial fraud in history. Additionally, the bill cuts the deficit by $33.6 billion over 10 years. 


	Small, community banks account for 54 percent of small business loans across the country. Small businesses make up 64 percent of net new private sector jobs.  By empowering community banks, the Financial CHOICE Act will help grow jobs and the economy in North Carolina.","June 8, 2017","Financial Services","null"

This legislation establishes minimum sentences for those convicted of Federal human trafficking crimes. The bill introduction was made during Combating Trafficking and Child Protection Week in Congress.

The BRIGHT Act comes after Congressman Walker’s successful efforts to combat human trafficking through H.R. 460, Human Trafficking Detection Act, which passed the House last year and was signed into law as part of S. 178, Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015. It also follows feedback from meetings in North Carolina’s 6th District with law enforcement agencies and organizations working to fight human trafficking. Walker originally introduced the BRIGHT Act during the 114th Congress.

“Human trafficking is one of the greatest injustices of our time,” Walker said. “ It destroys, enslaves and exploits human life. This abhorrent crime needs to be treated with the seriousness it deserves.”

“I am grateful for the progress we have made to combat human trafficking locally and nationally – but it’s not enough,” Walker added. “Life is invaluable and we must do all we can to protect it at every stage.”

This bill is part of an effort of overall sentencing reform to ensure that crimes are treated with the seriousness they deserve. For some, this means reducing proposed sentences. For others, like human trafficking, it means treating them as the serious crimes that they are.

The following is an excerpt of the statements made by Congressman Walker:  


	“As this Administration has done time and time again, they attacked someone who refused to enforce their political agenda. This time it was different though. When you attack our community, we fight back. And here, we not only fought, but we won.


	“The Department of Justice came in and froze money, blocked necessary grants, and caused funds that needed to be spent on Alamance County and the protection of the people to be spent on defending this needless lawsuit. This money should have been spent investing in jobs or building schools and providing better education and opportunity to our students. Instead it went to defending our community from political attacks, placing the deputies and the citizens of Alamance County at risk in the process.


	“I am proud of the work my office did to force the Justice Department to free up frozen Alamance County funds and right some of the wrongs that occurred here. It is my hope now that Sheriff Johnson and his department can move forward and continue protecting the citizens of Alamance County.”

This bill allows disabled veterans to contribute to their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account, using their disability compensation.


	Last year, Congress gave our servicemen and servicewomen a new way to save for retirement by allowing them to contribute money to a TSP.  The TSPs act similar to a 401k, deferring taxes and helping members of the military build a nest egg for the future.


	However, under current law our service members are not able to contribute to their retirement once they transition back to civilian life. This makes saving for the future difficult, especially for the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, 40% of whom are disabled when they come home.


	""Our disabled veterans may leave the military, but they never leave service to our country. Their sacrifice and many of their injuries stay with them,"" Walker said. ""The Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act will allow our heroes to be better equipped to make the transition back to civilian life.


	""By allowing disabled veterans to keep contributing to their TSP after they leave the Armed Forces will help them gain more financial independence,"" Walker added. 


	This retirement provision was based on recommendations from the Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC). It also comes following Walker hosting multiple roundtables with veterans in the community and getting feedback.

“This legislation will remove harmful and useless penalties that punish manufacturers for hiring and investing in our communities. We have worked hard to deliver on this reform that will lead to millions of dollars being reinvested in North Carolina as we continue to lead the nation in manufacturing and economic growth. It is my hope that my colleagues will move quickly to send this bipartisan bill to the President’s desk.”


	This bill is the result of efforts by Walker and Members of the House Ways and Means Committee in the 114th Congress on H.R. 4923, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act – legislation that revived and reformed a process for American businesses to apply for a suspension of harmful tariffs on materials that are needed, but not made in the United States.


	Part of that process is for businesses to petition the independent, non-partisan International Trade Commission (ITC), and following review and rejection based on any request that would impact a U.S. producer, the ITC reports the petitions to Congress for consideration as legislation. The collection of those petitions is the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018.


	“[Walker] was the champion for this,” Leib Oehmig, President and Chief Operating Officer of Glen Raven Inc. in Glen Raven, N.C., said. (See Oehmig’s full testimony to Congress in a 2016 hearing here.)

					The Challenge submission period will run from July 18, 2016 through November 2, 2016. The competition is open to all students who meet the eligibility requirements, regardless of coding experience. We strongly encourage students of all skill levels to participate, to learn how to create their own apps. Winners will be selected by panels of judges, drawn from the local community, and honored by their Member of Congress. Their apps will be featured on a display in the U.S. Capitol building and on the Congressional App Challenge website.

					 

					The CAC was created because Congress recognized that STEM and computer-based skills are essential for economic growth and innovation, and that the U.S. has been falling behind on these fronts. By some estimates, the U.S. may be short by many as a million programmers by 2020. These are high-paying, in-demand jobs. To maintain American competitiveness, it’s crucial that the United States invests in our youth now, and helps them acquire these valuable skills. The CAC encourages students to pursue those skills and recognizes them for their efforts.

					 

					Recognizing the racial, gendered, and other disparities in the tech sector, the CAC also focuses on inclusivity and making the Challenge as accessible as possible to people from all backgrounds. Deliberate efforts will be made to include students from all backgrounds, including those traditionally underrepresented in tech. The Internet Education Foundation will be serving as the operational “sponsor” of the CAC.

	The lack of diversity the Hill has been a well-documented issue. A recent study found that African-Americans make up less than one percent of top Senate staffers, despite representing 13 percent of the U.S. population. Reps. Walker and Adams are taking action to change this course. 

	 

	The HBCU Bi-Partisan Congressional Internship program is the first of its kind, featuring two interns, who will each spend a four-week period in the office of both a Republican and a Democrat. The interns in the program will also have the opportunity to meet with key players on Capitol Hill, including Members of Congress and senior staff. They will also have to meet performance standards that ensure a quality, educational experience, including attending hearings and briefings, writing letters, completing projects, and writing an essay about their time and what they learned.

	 

	“For too long Republicans have talked about minority outreach without taking any meaningful action. This internship program will open doors by providing HBCU students the chance to learn about Congress, and how political issues are viewed by each side of the aisle,” Walker said. “To solve the issues that our nation faces, we need perspectives from all walks of life. With the HBCU Bi-Partisan Congressional Internship program, we hope to start a precedent on Capitol Hill that leads to increased opportunity and legislative engagement from the African-American community.”

	 

	Vashti Hinton of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University and Quanetta King of Johnson C. Smith University were selected as the first two students to be a part of the internship.

	 

	“It was nice to see so many people come out to support this program, I have very high hopes for its success. I am honored to be one of the first to help lift it off the ground,” Hinton said. “I hope that this internship will begin to redefine the future of HBCU students on Capitol Hill, and also hopefully encourage more diversity when it comes to staffers on the Hill in the future.”

	 

	“We are delighted to have one of our top student leaders participate in the first-ever HBCU Caucus internship program. The opportunity presented to Vashti, will allow her to apply the theories of political thought presented in the classroom, to the real world scenarios presented in both congressional offices and vice versa,” said Dr. Melody Pierce, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at NC A&T in Greensboro, N.C.. “We commend Congressman Mark Walker and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University alumna, Congresswoman Alma Adams for not only being committed to the idea of diversity, but also development of the structure necessary to achieve it. This is a true example of how bipartisanship effectively supports the next generation of great minds.”

	 

	“As the daughter of two HBCU graduates, it is with pride that I bring my HBCU legacy to Capitol Hill. During my experience working, I've had the opportunity to learn how Congress works and the ins and outs of how our laws are made,” King stated. “By attending meetings with staffers and networking with Hill staffers, I've met a lot of amazing people, who've all been willing to share what they know. I'm grateful to be afforded this educational opportunity that few people receive.”

	 

	""The Bipartisan HBCU Internship Program is an excellent opportunity for top Political Science students, such as JCSU's Quanetta King, to experience the political process up close and personal,” said Kimberlee Archie, the Student Employment & Internship Coordinator at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, NC. “To live and work in our nation's Capitol and see the inner workings of Congress, not only from the Democratic side, but also the Republican side, is the type of professional development and exposure students need to prepare for their journey post graduation.""

Walker Introduces Bill to Help Veterans Save For Retirement","WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) recently introduced H.R. 6089, the Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act of 2016. This bill allows disabled veterans to contribute to their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account, using their disability compensation.


	Last year, Congress gave our servicemen and servicewomen a new way to save for retirement by allowing them to contribute money to a TSP.  The TSPs act similar to a 401k, deferring taxes and helping members of the military build a nest egg for the future.


	However, under current law our service members are not able to contribute to their retirement once they transition back to civilian life. This makes saving for the future difficult, especially for the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, 40% of whom are disabled when they come home.


	""Our disabled veterans may leave the military, but they never leave service to our country. Their sacrifice and many of their injuries stay with them,"" Walker said. ""The Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act will allow our heroes to be better equipped to make the transition back to civilian life.


	""By allowing disabled veterans to keep contributing to their TSP after they leave the Armed Forces will help them gain more financial independence,"" Walker added. 


	This retirement provision was based on recommendations from the Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC). It also comes following Walker hosting multiple roundtables with veterans in the community and getting feedback.

""That gets at the heart of what is wrong with the way we are currently treating our college athletes. The system lacks accountability for the NCAA, schools, coaches and players, opening the door for corruption in what has grown to a $12 billion a year industry.""

""In the coming weeks, we will continue to engage in a national discussion on solutions and whether Congress needs to get involved,"" Walker added.

	January 30, 2017


	Dear President Trump,


	The consideration of the impeachment of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen in the House in late 2016 was a clear indication that Congress and the American people have no confidence in Commissioner Koskinen or his ability to discharge his duties.


	The IRS, through its targeting of citizens for their political beliefs, has forfeited the trust of a free people.  The IRS has admitted to improperly targeting conservative groups, delaying applications for tax-exempt status from 2010-2012, with at least 75 groups selected for extra scrutiny. Moreover, in August 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the IRS had yet to demonstrate that officials have definitively ceased targeting conservative groups. The ruling came at the heels of evidence that two targeted conservative groups continued to have delayed applications for tax-exempt status pending at the IRS. 


	Congressional investigations, hearings, and actions have shown that Commissioner Koskinen misled Congress, obstructed investigations into the IRS, and failed to comply with Congressional subpoenas. Commissioner Koskinen’s willful deception and obstructionism has only further eroded any remaining confidence.


	Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7803, you have the authority to remove Commissioner Koskinen. We encourage you to dismiss him in the most expedient manner practicable.  Such an action would restore the credibility of our Federal tax authority and the faith the American people have in their Constitutional rights to free speech and association.

After losing the life of her dear friend Sherri in 2006, Ms. Shipman created the organization on June 26, 2008 to help victims of domestic violence reclaim their lives by breaking free from domestic abuse and educating the community in hopes to save lives. 


	Since then, the Sherri Denese Jackson Foundation has expanded its vision and goals. They have had hundreds of people participate in their programs and have reached thousands through public awareness campaigns, as well as through their website. For 9 years she has dedicated herself to saving the lives of women, one life at a time. 

Shipman also opened her home to a family seeking refuge from Hurricane Irma last year. 

“Facing hardship and the loss of a friend, Portia decided to make a difference and has since reached thousands,” Walker said. “Having spent years in ministry and offering counseling to survivors, I know how critical education and prevention of domestic abuse is.

	“When I talk to the people of North Carolina, a common sentiment I hear is the American Dream is fading,"" Walker said. ""This concern becomes reality driving on Front St. in Burlington or Steele St. in Sanford, observing the vanished local banks that used to serve as the epicenter of growth for our community. Burdening regulations have diminished the backbone of our local economy and the true cost can only be measured in small businesses not started, workers not hired and dreams not filled. With our vote on the Financial CHOICE Act, we can start to reverse course and upend the country’s historically slow economic recovery, while placing the stiffest penalties in history on Wall Street abuse.”


	In 2010 (the year the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law), North Carolina's 6th District's housed nine community banks including CommunityOne Bank in Asheboro, NewBridge Bank in Greensboro, and Mid-Carolina Bank in Burlington. Today, that number is only two as Dodd-Frank regulations have forced closures and mergers across North Carolina. In fact, community banks are closing at a national rate of one per day. Meanwhile, the five largest banks in the country have grown their domestic assets by more than 40 percent during the same time. 


	Instead of fixing the causes at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, the 2,300-plus page Dodd-Frank bill codified into law “too big to fail” and taxpayer-funded bailouts. And instead of being tough on Wall Street, it put many local banks out of business because they did not have the resources to navigate the expansive and costly regulations. The effect has been seen in communities nationwide.  


	Dodd-Frank has also been noted as a major cause of our ongoing economic recovery – which is the slowest and weakest in 70 years. 

The Financial CHOICE Act reins in Dodd-Frank and gives local banks and small businesses an opportunity for success. The bill would protect taxpayers from paying for more Wall Street bailouts, forcing failing banks and financial institutions to go through bankruptcy like any other company.


	The Financial CHOICE Act also holds Wall Street accountable by imposing the toughest penalties for financial fraud in history. Additionally, the bill cuts the deficit by $33.6 billion over 10 years. 


	Small, community banks account for 54 percent of small business loans across the country. Small businesses make up 64 percent of net new private sector jobs.  By empowering community banks, the Financial CHOICE Act will help grow jobs and the economy in North Carolina.","June 8, 2017","Spending Cuts and Debt","null"

Howard Coble Post Office Building. The post office to be renamed is located at 1585 Yanceyville Street.

The introduction of this bill comes just before what would have been Coble's 87th birthday on March 18th. 

""North Carolina was blessed to have the leadership of Howard Coble in Congress for thirty years, but we were even more blessed to call him a friend and mentor,"" Walker said. ""During his time in Washington, Congressman Coble demonstrated that tone, approach, and a heart of service still matter in our political discourse. After being a staple of our community for decades, it is fitting that we have this permanent reminder of his service.""

John Howard Coble was born in Greensboro, Guilford County, N.C., on March 18, 1931. After graduating from high school, he briefly attended Appalachian State University before serving 5 years in the United States Coast Guard. After leaving active duty in 1956, he continued to serve in the United States Coast Guard Reserve from 1960-1982.


	Coble received a degree in History from Guildford College in 1958 and a J.D from University of North Carolina School of Law, Chapel Hill in 1962. Coble worked in the insurance industry, was assistant U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, and was secretary of the North Carolina Department of Revenue. Coble served one term in the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1969 and again from 1979-1984.


	In 1984, Coble was elected to represent North Carolina’s 6th District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He would end up serving for 15 terms and 30 years, the longest period ever served by a North Carolina Republican.


	Coble served on the Judiciary Committee and chaired the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet. During the advent of the internet in the 1990’s he worked to strengthen copyright and patent laws. In retirement, he refused to take his congressional pension – Coble believed in being fiscally responsible and thought his salary was sufficient enough compensation.


	Known for his kind and affable demeanor, Coble was respected by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. More importantly, he was beloved by the people of North Carolina’s 6th congressional district. Coble never forgot about the people he was serving back home – he participated in over 200 local Christmas parades and another 200 Eagle Scout ceremonies. Coble had a keen memory for names and faces and knew the high school mascots for schools from all over North Carolina. 


	In 2013, citing his declining health, Coble announced he would not seek re-election to a 16th term. In January 2015, Coble concluded his 30 years of service in United States House of Representatives. In November 2015, Coble passed away from health issues related to his age, leaving behind a lifelong legacy of friendship, patriotism, and commitment to conservative principles.","March 6, 2018","","null"

This legislation would save taxpayer money and bring needed accountability to federal agencies by requiring them to report on the status of Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (IG) recommendations in their annual budget justification. The GAO-IG Act is a House companion bill to S.2276, introduced by U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

These changes represent potential savings of at least $87 billion for taxpayers as agencies will be forced to improve based on IG and GAO recommendations or will be required to provide justification for not implementing the recommendations.


	As of 2016, there were more than 15,000 open and unimplemented federal agency recommendations from the IG and more than 8,000 open GAO federal agency recommendations.

“Right now, North Carolina taxpayers are having their hard-earned money wasted by federal bureaucrats who have been told how to improve and become more efficient, but refuse to follow recommendations,” Walker said. “That is unacceptable. This bipartisan legislation will make government better, more accountable, and save taxpayer dollars.”

“This bipartisan bill will help make our federal government more accountable and save taxpayer dollars - two things Hoosiers want,” said Senator Young. “Ensuring Congress has the information necessary to conduct effective oversight will lead to increased transparency for federal agencies and better service to taxpayers.” 

“I’m glad to partner with Senator Young on a bill that gives Congress a powerful tool to hold agencies accountable and make sure they are working on behalf of American families,” said Senator Warren. “This bipartisan bill will make our government more transparent and effective – and save taxpayers real money.”

Each month, Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them.

Lacy Winstead is a native of Roxboro, N.C. and is retired from careers in both agriculture and real estate.   He was part of an original group of citizens who saw the need for public school choice in Person County and was very instrumental in the building of Roxboro Community School.   The school serves both middle and high school students, and is located in a historic building that once served as a cotton mill. 
 
“When I first met Lacy Winstead last year, I was impressed that a everyday citizen would be willing to sacrifice so much time and effort to not only preserve an important historic building, but create a unique space in the community for students from all walks of life to learn and grow,” Walker said. “It took vision and perseverance to complete the building and make this charter school a reality, and Mr. Winstead has left a legacy that will impact many generations for years to come.”

This bill allows disabled veterans to contribute to their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account, using their disability compensation.


	In 2015, Congress gave our servicemen and servicewomen a new way to save for retirement by allowing them to contribute money to a TSP.  The TSPs act similar to a 401k, deferring taxes and helping members of the military build a nest egg for the future.


	However, under current law our service members are not able to contribute to their retirement once they transition back to civilian life. This makes saving for the future difficult, especially for the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, 40% of whom are disabled when they come home.

""Our disabled veterans may leave the military, but they never leave service to our country,”Walker said. “Their sacrifice and many of their injuries stay with them. The Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act will allow our heroes to keep contributing to their TSP after they leave the Armed Forces and empower them with a more secure financial future.”


	This retirement provision was based on recommendations from the Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC). It also comes following Walker hosting multiple roundtables with veterans in the community and getting feedback on policy proposals.

GOP Maps a Road to Nowhere in November
The Wall Street Journal

	By Mark Walker

	January 15, 2018


	Despite the constant media portrayal of disarray, 2017 was a productive year for the first unified Republican government in a decade. Not only did we pass a once-in-a-generation tax reform, we repealed ObamaCare’s most onerous and unpopular provision, the individual mandate.


	Democrats should be anxious about heading into midterm elections as Americans reap the benefits of tax reform and deregulation. If Republicans maintain our momentum, we can retain our majorities in the House and Senate. Yet I fear we may be giving Democrats a fighting chance by bringing back a practice that epitomizes swamp-style politics: earmarking.


	Officially banned in 2011, earmarks give members of Congress the ability to direct federal spending toward specific projects, usually in their own districts. Conservatives traditionally oppose such giveaways, but Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that the House will look into reviving the practice. He shouldn’t bow to the demands of members who claim earmarking is a legitimate part of Congress’s power of the purse.


	This bad idea is gaining traction partly because most House Republicans took their seats after the 2011 ban. They have little memory of past abuses like Alaska’s “Bridge to Nowhere.” They never had to endure the meetings where lobbyists pressured them to grovel before the Appropriations Committee for pork. The moniker “cardinals” for subcommittee chairmen is an anachronism; they no longer have unilateral powers to redirect billions in spending on a whim.


	When earmarks were allowed and encouraged, bills passed on shady favors and chumminess rather than on their merits. This practice helped produce what we now call the swamp. It wasn’t so long ago that the GOP used a platform of banning earmarks and controlling spending to help ride a major political wave and take control of the House. This message was a precursor to President Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” and end a status quo that benefits Washington insiders over ordinary Americans.


	An earmark revival—even as the U.S. courts trillion-dollar deficits—would risk handing Democrats a tool to transform their “resistance” into a political force capable of achieving tea-party-style electoral victories. If Republicans bring back earmarks, you can bet that Democrats plant the blame of every subsequent earmark on Republicans. It’s only a matter of time before there is another politically catastrophic “Bridge to Nowhere.”


	Earmarks also lead to bad policy. I am willing to listen to reform proposals, but historically earmarks have opened the gates to out-of-control spending as members compete with one another to bring home the bacon. The price for every bill tends to rise as members hold their affirmative votes until money for their own pet projects are slipped into legislation. Earmarks for Medicare and Medicaid greased the legislative gears to pass ObamaCare, a bad policy that plagued American families with year after year of premium hikes.


	President Trump recently said he supports bringing back earmarks, apparently hoping it will make legislation easier to pass. But if the political backlash helps Democrats take the House, the legislative agenda will consist simply of impeaching Mr. Trump for whatever the latest controversy is. Democrats likely will abuse the power of Congress to ramp up the Russia investigation and subpoena anyone who ever drank Russian vodka. (For the record, I’d be safe.)


	Instead of looking to tried-and-failed methods of the past, Republicans should keep our focus on fulfilling the promises made by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration to the American people. Reviving earmarks would threaten to bring our party’s momentum to a screeching halt.","January 16, 2018","Spending Cuts and Debt","null"

“For too long, North Carolinians have anxiously opened envelopes to find that their health insurance has been cancelled or they have watched their premiums skyrocket because of Obamacare,"" Walker said. ""For long enough, families have sat around kitchen tables, struggling to decide between paying for health insurance they cannot afford to use or a tax penalty they cannot escape. These cries for relief from Obamacare could not be ignored.""


	“It’s time that voters who have poured to the polls for the last several elections – rewarding Republicans with historic majorities – were heard,"" Walker added. ""It’s time the less fortunate and those who struggle with pre-existing health conditions were given legitimate options, not a one-size-fits-all mandate. It’s time to fix the broken government policies that have crippled our health-care system for decades. It’s finally time we keep our promise to repeal Obamacare and provide relief. Today, we took the first big step to keeping that promise.”

Walker's support for the AHCA follows weeks of negotiations between the House ofRepresentatives and the White House that resulted in constructive amendments being added.

The Wall Street Journal said the AHCA ""would be the most consequential GOP social-policy reform since the welfare overhaul of 1996… it starts to correct many of the government created dysfunctions that have bedeviled U.S. health care for decades.""

National Review noted “the bill as it stands would abolish Obamacare’s fines on people without health insurance, reduce taxes and spending, reform Medicaid by moving it closer to federalist principles, and open the door to deregulation in states that choose to pursue it.”


	The AHCA repeals Obamacare taxes and provides nearly $1 trillion in tax relief for families. It repeals many of Obamacare’s mandates that have increased premiums and cost. The legislation also protects life by defunding Planned Parenthood and ensuring that taxpayer dollars don’t go to funding abortions. Instead, it redirects the money to community health centers that offer more comprehensive services.

The legislation will now move to the Senate, where under rules for a reconciliation legislation, the vote total required to file cloture is a simple majority rather than thetraditional 60-vote threshold.


	Prior to voting for the AHCA, the House passed H.R. 2192 , ""To amend the Public Health Service Act to eliminate the non-application of certain State waiver provisions to Members of Congress and congressional staff,"" with the support of Walker. Walker is a co-sponsor of H.R. 2192, which would eliminate the ability for members of Congress and staff to be exempt from the AHCA.","May 4, 2017","Health Care","null"

You just heard will Democrats participate? Well, 80% of Americans support ending sanctuary cities, and no citizen should be in danger because politicians think they are above the law. So, will democrats participate? Will the listen to their constituents? 80% of Americans feel good about this law. Both pieces of legislation serve the basic functions of our government by keeping people of our state and country safe from those who wish to do us harm.

“This is a moral injustice,” Walker said. “The existence of a secret hush fund that uses taxpayer money to settle sexual misconduct from members of Congress highlights exactly why people don’t trust Washington. We need to eliminate this abhorrent process immediately and create a system where members of Congress are held to the same standard as the people they represent.""

Since 1997, the Office of Compliance has paid out more than $17 million in taxpayer funds to settle claims, including sexual harassment claims, on behalf of members of Congress and congressional staff. The settlements are kept private, and the names of the members of Congress and/or staffers are kept secret. This bill would change that.

“President Trump made the right call in deeming these payments unlawful. Under no circumstance should Congress attempt to expand Obamacare by cutting a check for President Obama’s bailout of insurance companies. Instead, Congress must fulfill the promise to repeal and replace Obamacare with high-quality, patient-centered health care.”

The CSR payments were illegal because Congress, who holds the constitutional power of the purse, never authorized the payments. They are the center of a 2014 lawsuit where House Republicans sued the Obama administration on the constitutionality of the payments directly to insurance companies, practically serving as a bail out. A Federal District Court judge agreed and ordered the payments had to be halted.

According to The New York Times: 

""Congress never provided explicit authority for the spending, she ruled. 'Such an appropriation cannot be inferred,' the judge said in her opinion. She blocked further spending under the program but said that order would be suspended pending an appeal by the Obama administration.""

In August, the Trump administration announced it would temporarily continue CSR payments. Following that decisionWalker said that ""we cannot dig our hands into a hole $20 trillion deep to bail out insurance companies.""

""Even worse, we will be adding insult to injury by masking the failures of Obamacare at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,"" Walker added. ""The people of North Carolina are already paying enough because of Obamacare’s pitfalls. Instead of the executive branch issuing unconstitutional payments to bail out insurance companies, the Senate should continue working until they have passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Their constituents are tired of their inability to fulfill their promise.”","October 13, 2017","Accountability","null"

Each month, Congressman Walker honors a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in their community.


	Inspired by the annual Wreaths Across America ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Wade Harvey and Mike Lapeirre worked to organize a similar event in the Greensboro area. The two fathers hoped to use the ceremony to educate their own children about freedom and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.


	Wade and Mike contacted Wreaths Across America and selected Forest Lawn Cemetery in Greensboro. With help from friends, family, and volunteers from the community, the pair have laid 1,100 wreaths in the veteran’s section of the cemetery every December since 2013.

“During this season, it is vital to remember the servicemen and servicewomen who have sacrificed so that we may know the blessings of freedom,” Walker said. “Seeing an opportunity to make a difference in our community, Wade and Mike took action and organized a powerful ceremony to show gratitude to our veterans. Because of their efforts, generations of heroes now know that we are thankful for their service and that their sacrifice will not be forgotten.”","December 15, 2017","","Walker presented Wade and Mike with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of their service.
